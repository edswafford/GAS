# GASDocumentation
My understanding of Unreal Engine 5's GameplayAbilitySystem plugin (GAS) with a simple multiplayer sample project. This is not official documentation and neither this project nor myself are affiliated with Epic Games. I make no guarantee for the accuracy of this information.

The goal of this documentation is to explain the major concepts and classes in GAS and provide some additional commentary based on my experience with it. There is a lot of 'tribal knowledge' of GAS among users in the community and I aim to share all of mine here.

The Sample Project and documentation are current with **Unreal Engine 5.2**. There are branches of this documentation for older versions of Unreal Engine, but they are no longer supported and are liable to have bugs or out of date information.

[GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) is a sister Sample Project demonstrating advanced techniques with GAS for a multiplayer FPS/TPS.

The best documentation will always be the plugin source code.

## 1. Intro to the GameplayAbilitySystem Plugin
From the [Official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/GameplayAbilitySystem/index.html):
>The Gameplay Ability System is a highly-flexible framework for building abilities and attributes of the type you might find in an RPG or MOBA title. You can build actions or passive abilities for the characters in your games to use, status effects that can build up or wear down various attributes as a result of these actions, implement "cooldown" timers or resource costs to regulate the usage of these actions, change the level of the ability and its effects at each level, activate particle or sound effects, and more. Put simply, this system can help you to design, implement, and efficiently network in-game abilities as simple as jumping or as complex as your favorite character's ability set in any modern RPG or MOBA title.

The GameplayAbilitySystem plugin is developed by Epic Games and comes with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). It has been battle tested in AAA commercial games such as Paragon and Fortnite among others.

The plugin provides an out-of-the-box solution in single and multiplayer games for:
* Implementing level-based character abilities or skills with optional costs and cooldowns ([GameplayAbilities](#concepts-ga))
* Manipulating numerical `Attributes` belonging to actors ([Attributes](#concepts-a))
* Applying status effects to actors ([GameplayEffects](#concepts-ge))
* Applying `GameplayTags` to actors ([GameplayTags](#concepts-gt))
* Spawning visual or sound effects ([GameplayCues](#concepts-gc))
* Replication of everything mentioned above

In multiplayer games, GAS provides support for [client-side prediction](#concepts-p) of:
* Ability activation
* Playing animation montages
* Changes to `Attributes`
* Applying `GameplayTags`
* Spawning `GameplayCues`
* Movement via `RootMotionSource` functions connected to the `CharacterMovementComponent`.

**GAS must be set up in C++**, but `GameplayAbilities` and `GameplayEffects` can be created in Blueprint by the designers.

Current issues with GAS:
* `GameplayEffect` latency reconciliation (can't predict ability cooldowns resulting in players with higher latencies having lower rate of fire for low cooldown abilities compared to players with lower latencies).
* Cannot predict the removal of `GameplayEffects`. We can however predict adding `GameplayEffects` with the inverse effects, effectively removing them. This is not always appropriate or feasible and still remains an issue.
* Lack of boilerplate templates, multiplayer examples, and documentation. Hopefully this helps with that!

## 2. Sample Project
A multiplayer third person shooter sample project is included with this documentation aimed at people new to the GameplayAbilitySystem Plugin but not new to Unreal Engine 5. Users are expected to know C++, Blueprints, UMG, Replication, and other intermediate topics in UE5. This project provides an example of how to set up a basic third person shooter multiplayer-ready project with the `AbilitySystemComponent` (`ASC`) on the `PlayerState` class for player/AI controlled heroes and the `ASC` on the `Character` class for AI controlled minions.

The goal is to keep this project simple while showing the GAS basics and demonstrating some commonly requested abilities with well-commented code. Because of its beginner focus, the project does not show advanced topics like [predicting projectiles](#concepts-p-spawn).

Concepts demonstrated:
* `ASC` on `PlayerState` vs `Character`
* Replicated `Attributes`
* Replicated animation montages
* `GameplayTags`
* Applying and removing `GameplayEffects` inside of and externally from `GameplayAbilities`
* Applying damage mitigated by armor to change health of a character
* `GameplayEffectExecutionCalculations`
* Stun effect
* Death and respawn
* Spawning actors (projectiles) from an ability on the server
* Predictively changing the local player's speed with aim down sights and sprinting
* Constantly draining stamina to sprint
* Using mana to cast abilities
* Passive abilities
* Stacking `GameplayEffects`
* Targeting actors
* `GameplayAbilities` created in Blueprint
* `GameplayAbilities` created in C++
* Instanced per `Actor` `GameplayAbilities`
* Non-Instanced `GameplayAbilities` (Jump)
* Static `GameplayCues` (FireGun projectile impact particle effect)
* Actor `GameplayCues` (Sprint and Stun particle effects)

The hero class has the following abilities:

| Ability              | Input Bind         | Predicted | C++ / Blueprint | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | --------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Jump                 | Space Bar          | Yes       | C++             | Makes the hero jump.                                                                                                                                     |
| Gun                  | Left Mouse Button  | No        | C++             | Fires a projectile from the hero's gun. The animation is predicted but the projectile is not.                                                            |
| Aim Down Sights      | Right Mouse Button | Yes       | Blueprint       | While the button is held, the hero will walk slower and the camera will zoom in to allow more precise shots with the gun.                                |
| Sprint               | Left Shift         | Yes       | Blueprint       | While the button is held, the hero will run faster draining stamina.                                                                                     |
| Forward Dash         | Q                  | Yes       | Blueprint       | The hero dashes forward at the cost of stamina.                                                                                                          |
| Passive Armor Stacks | Passive            | No        | Blueprint       | Every 4 seconds the hero gains a stack of armor up to a maximum of 4 stacks. Receiving damage removes one stack of armor.                                |
| Meteor               | R                  | No        | Blueprint       | Player targets a location to drop a meteor on the enemies causing damage and stunning them. The targeting is predicted while spawning the meteor is not. |

It does not matter if `GameplayAbilities` are created in C++ or Blueprint. A mixture of the two were used here for example of how to do them in each language.

Minions do not come with any predefined `GameplayAbilities`. The Red Minions have more health regen while the Blue Minions have higher starting health.

For `GameplayAbility` naming, I used the suffix `_BP` to denote the `GameplayAbility's` logic was created in Blueprint. The lack of suffix means the logic was created in C++.

**Blueprint Asset Naming Prefixes**

| Prefix | Asset Type      |
| ------ | --------------- |
| GA_    | GameplayAbility |
| GC_    | GameplayCue     |
| GE_    | GameplayEffect  |

## 3. Setting Up a Project Using GAS
Basic steps to set up a project using GAS:


1. Enable GameplayAbilitySystem plugin in the Editor
1. Edit `YourProjectName.Build.cs` to add `"GameplayAbilities", "GameplayTags", "GameplayTasks"` to your `PrivateDependencyModuleNames`
1. Refresh/Regenerate your Visual Studio project files
1. Starting with 4.24, it is now mandatory to call `UAbilitySystemGlobals::Get().InitGlobalData()` to use [`TargetData`](#concepts-targeting-data). The Sample Project does this in `UAssetManager::StartInitialLoading()`. See [`InitGlobalData()`](#concepts-asg-initglobaldata) for more information.

That's all that you have to do to enable GAS. From here, add an [`ASC`](#concepts-asc) and [`AttributeSet`](#concepts-as) to your `Character` or `PlayerState` and start making [`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) and [`GameplayEffects`](#concepts-ge)!

<a name="concepts-asc"></a>
### 4.1 Ability System Component
The `AbilitySystemComponent` (`ASC`) is the heart of GAS. It's a `UActorComponent` ([`UAbilitySystemComponent`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/UAbilitySystemComponent/index.html)) that handles all interactions with the system. Any `Actor` that wishes to use [`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga), have [`Attributes`](#concepts-a), or receive [`GameplayEffects`](#concepts-ge) must have one `ASC` attached to them. These objects all live inside of and are managed and replicated by (with the exception of `Attributes` which are replicated by their [`AttributeSet`](#concepts-as)) the `ASC`. Developers are expected but not required to subclass this.

The `Actor` with the `ASC` attached to it is referred to as the `OwnerActor` of the `ASC`. The physical representation `Actor` of the `ASC` is called the `AvatarActor`. The `OwnerActor` and the `AvatarActor` can be the same `Actor` as in the case of a simple AI minion in a MOBA game. They can also be different `Actors` as in the case of a player controlled hero in a MOBA game where the `OwnerActor` is the `PlayerState` and the `AvatarActor` is the hero's `Character` class. Most `Actors` will have the `ASC` on themselves. If your `Actor` will respawn and need persistence of `Attributes` or `GameplayEffects` between spawns (like a hero in a MOBA), then the ideal location for the `ASC` is on the `PlayerState`.

**Note:** If your `ASC` is on your `PlayerState`, then you will need to increase the `NetUpdateFrequency` of your `PlayerState`. It defaults to a very low value on the `PlayerState` and can cause delays or perceived lag before changes to things like `Attributes` and `GameplayTags` happen on the clients. Be sure to enable [`Adaptive Network Update Frequency`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/Networking/Actors/Properties/index.html#adaptivenetworkupdatefrequency), Fortnite uses it.

Both, the `OwnerActor` and the `AvatarActor` if different `Actors`, should implement the `IAbilitySystemInterface`. This interface has one function that must be overriden, `UAbilitySystemComponent* GetAbilitySystemComponent() const`, which returns a pointer to its `ASC`. `ASCs` interact with each other internally to the system by looking for this interface function.

The `ASC` holds its current active `GameplayEffects` in `FActiveGameplayEffectsContainer ActiveGameplayEffects`.

The `ASC` holds its granted `Gameplay Abilities` in `FGameplayAbilitySpecContainer ActivatableAbilities`. Any time that you plan to iterate over `ActivatableAbilities.Items`, be sure to add `ABILITYLIST_SCOPE_LOCK();` above your loop to lock the list from changing (due to removing an ability). Every `ABILITYLIST_SCOPE_LOCK();` in scope increments `AbilityScopeLockCount` and then decrements when it falls out of scope. Do not try to remove an ability inside the scope of `ABILITYLIST_SCOPE_LOCK();` (the clear ability functions check `AbilityScopeLockCount` internally to prevent removing abilities if the list is locked).

<a name="concepts-asc-rm"></a>
### 4.1.1 Replication Mode
The `ASC` defines three different replication modes for replicating `GameplayEffects`, `GameplayTags`, and `GameplayCues` - `Full`, `Mixed`, and `Minimal`. `Attributes` are replicated by their `AttributeSet`.

| Replication Mode | When to Use                             | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Full`           | Single Player                           | Every `GameplayEffect` is replicated to every client.                                                                          |
| `Mixed`          | Multiplayer, player controlled `Actors` | `GameplayEffects` are only replicated to the owning client. Only `GameplayTags` and `GameplayCues` are replicated to everyone. |
| `Minimal`        | Multiplayer, AI controlled `Actors`     | `GameplayEffects` are never replicated to anyone. Only `GameplayTags` and `GameplayCues` are replicated to everyone.           |

**Note:** `Mixed` replication mode expects the `OwnerActor's` `Owner` to be the `Controller`. `PlayerState's` `Owner` is the `Controller` by default but `Character's` is not. If using `Mixed` replication mode with the `OwnerActor` not the `PlayerState`, then you need to call `SetOwner()` on the `OwnerActor` with a valid `Controller`.

Starting with 4.24, `PossessedBy()` now sets the owner of the `Pawn` to the new `Controller`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-asc-setup"></a>
### 4.1.2 Setup and Initialization
`ASCs` are typically constructed in the `OwnerActor's` constructor and explicitly marked replicated. **This must be done in C++**.

```c++
AGDPlayerState::AGDPlayerState()
{
	// Create ability system component, and set it to be explicitly replicated
	AbilitySystemComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<UGDAbilitySystemComponent>(TEXT("AbilitySystemComponent"));
	AbilitySystemComponent->SetIsReplicated(true);
	//...
}
```

The `ASC` needs to be initialized with its `OwnerActor` and `AvatarActor` on both the server and the client. You want to initialize after the `Pawn's` `Controller` has been set (after possession). Single player games only need to worry about the server path.

For player controlled characters where the `ASC` lives on the `Pawn`, I typically initialize on the server in the `Pawn's` `PossessedBy()` function and initialize on the client in the `PlayerController's` `AcknowledgePossession()` function.

```c++
void APACharacterBase::PossessedBy(AController * NewController)
{
	Super::PossessedBy(NewController);

	if (AbilitySystemComponent)
	{
		AbilitySystemComponent->InitAbilityActorInfo(this, this);
	}

	// ASC MixedMode replication requires that the ASC Owner's Owner be the Controller.
	SetOwner(NewController);
}
```

```c++
void APAPlayerControllerBase::AcknowledgePossession(APawn* P)
{
	Super::AcknowledgePossession(P);

	APACharacterBase* CharacterBase = Cast<APACharacterBase>(P);
	if (CharacterBase)
	{
		CharacterBase->GetAbilitySystemComponent()->InitAbilityActorInfo(CharacterBase, CharacterBase);
	}

	//...
}
```

For player controlled characters where the `ASC` lives on the `PlayerState`, I typically initialize the server in the `Pawn's` `PossessedBy()` function and initialize on the client in the `Pawn's` `OnRep_PlayerState()` function. This ensures that the `PlayerState` exists on the client.

```c++
// Server only
void AGDHeroCharacter::PossessedBy(AController * NewController)
{
	Super::PossessedBy(NewController);

	AGDPlayerState* PS = GetPlayerState<AGDPlayerState>();
	if (PS)
	{
		// Set the ASC on the Server. Clients do this in OnRep_PlayerState()
		AbilitySystemComponent = Cast<UGDAbilitySystemComponent>(PS->GetAbilitySystemComponent());

		// AI won't have PlayerControllers so we can init again here just to be sure. No harm in initing twice for heroes that have PlayerControllers.
		PS->GetAbilitySystemComponent()->InitAbilityActorInfo(PS, this);
	}
	
	//...
}
```

```c++
// Client only
void AGDHeroCharacter::OnRep_PlayerState()
{
	Super::OnRep_PlayerState();

	AGDPlayerState* PS = GetPlayerState<AGDPlayerState>();
	if (PS)
	{
		// Set the ASC for clients. Server does this in PossessedBy.
		AbilitySystemComponent = Cast<UGDAbilitySystemComponent>(PS->GetAbilitySystemComponent());

		// Init ASC Actor Info for clients. Server will init its ASC when it possesses a new Actor.
		AbilitySystemComponent->InitAbilityActorInfo(PS, this);
	}

	// ...
}
```

If you get the error message `LogAbilitySystem: Warning: Can't activate LocalOnly or LocalPredicted ability %s when not local!` then you did not initialize your `ASC` on the client.

<a name="concepts-gt"></a>
### 4.2 Gameplay Tags
[`FGameplayTags`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Runtime/GameplayTags/FGameplayTag/index.html) are hierarchical names in the form of `Parent.Child.Grandchild...` that are registered with the `GameplayTagManager`. These tags are incredibly useful for classifying and describing the state of an object. For example, if a character is stunned, we could give it a `State.Debuff.Stun` `GameplayTag` for the duration of the stun.

You will find yourself replacing things that you used to handle with booleans or enums with `GameplayTags` and doing boolean logic on whether or not objects have certain `GameplayTags`.

When giving tags to an object, we typically add them to its `ASC` if it has one so that GAS can interact with them. `UAbilitySystemComponent` implements the `IGameplayTagAssetInterface` giving functions to access its owned `GameplayTags`.

Multiple `GameplayTags` can be stored in an `FGameplayTagContainer`. It is preferable to use a `GameplayTagContainer` over a `TArray<FGameplayTag>` since the `GameplayTagContainers` add some efficiency magic. While tags are standard `FNames`, they can be efficiently packed together in `FGameplayTagContainers` for replication if `Fast Replication` is enabled in the project settings. `Fast Replication` requires that the server and the clients have the same list of `GameplayTags`. This generally shouldn't be a problem so you should enable this option. `GameplayTagContainers` can also return a `TArray<FGameplayTag>` for iteration.

`GameplayTags` stored in `FGameplayTagCountContainer` have a `TagMap` that stores the number of instances of that `GameplayTag`. A `FGameplayTagCountContainer` may still have the `GameplayTag` in it but its `TagMapCount` is zero. You may encounter this while debugging if an `ASC` still has a `GameplayTag`. Any of the `HasTag()` or `HasMatchingTag()` or similar functions will check the `TagMapCount` and return false if the `GameplayTag` is not present or its `TagMapCount` is zero.

`GameplayTags` must be defined ahead of time in the `DefaultGameplayTags.ini`. The UE5 Editor provides an interface in the project settings to let developers manage `GameplayTags` without needing to manually edit the `DefaultGameplayTags.ini`. The `GameplayTag` editor can create, rename, search for references, and delete `GameplayTags`.

![GameplayTag Editor in Project Settings](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/gameplaytageditor.png)

Searching for `GameplayTag` references will bring up the familiar `Reference Viewer` graph in the Editor showing all the assets that reference the `GameplayTag`. This will not however show any C++ classes that reference the `GameplayTag`.

Renaming `GameplayTags` creates a redirect so that assets still referencing the original `GameplayTag` can redirect to the new `GameplayTag`. I prefer if possible to instead create a new `GameplayTag`, update all the references manually to the new `GameplayTag`, and then delete the old `GameplayTag` to avoid creating a redirect.

In addition to `Fast Replication`, the `GameplayTag` editor has an option to fill in commonly replicated `GameplayTags` to optimize them further.

`GameplayTags` are replicated if they're added from a `GameplayEffect`. The `ASC` allows you to add `LooseGameplayTags` that are not replicated and must be managed manually. The Sample Project uses a `LooseGameplayTag` for `State.Dead` so that the owning clients can immediately respond to when their health drops to zero. Respawning manually sets the `TagMapCount` back to zero. Only manually adjust the `TagMapCount` when working with `LooseGameplayTags`. It is preferable to use the `UAbilitySystemComponent::AddLooseGameplayTag()` and `UAbilitySystemComponent::RemoveLooseGameplayTag()` functions than manually adjusting the `TagMapCount`.

Getting a reference to a `GameplayTag` in C++:
```c++
FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag(FName("Your.GameplayTag.Name"))
```

For advanced `GameplayTag` manipulation like getting the parent or children `GameplayTags`, look at the functions offered by the `GameplayTagManager`. To access the `GameplayTagManager`, include `GameplayTagManager.h` and call it with `UGameplayTagManager::Get().FunctionName`. The `GameplayTagManager` actually stores the `GameplayTags` as relational nodes (parent, child, etc) for faster processing than constant string manipulation and comparisons.

`GameplayTags` and `GameplayTagContainers` can have the optional `UPROPERTY` specifier `Meta = (Categories = "GameplayCue")` that filters the tags in the Blueprint to show only `GameplayTags` that have the parent tag of `GameplayCue`. This is useful when you know the `GameplayTag` or `GameplayTagContainer` variable should only be used for `GameplayCues`.

Alternatively, there's a separate structure called `FGameplayCueTag` that encapsulates a `FGameplayTag` and also automatically filters `GameplayTags` in Blueprint to only show those tags with the parent tag of `GameplayCue`.

If you want to filter a `GameplayTag` parameter in a function, use the `UFUNCTION` specifier `Meta = (GameplayTagFilter = "GameplayCue")`. `GameplayTagContainer` parameters in functions can not be filtered. If you would like to edit your engine to allow this, look at how `SGameplayTagGraphPin::ParseDefaultValueData()` from `Engine\Plugins\Editor\GameplayTagsEditor\Source\GameplayTagsEditor\Private\SGameplayTagGraphPin.cpp` calls `FilterString = UGameplayTagsManager::Get().GetCategoriesMetaFromField(PinStructType);` and passes `FilterString` to `SGameplayTagWidget` in `SGameplayTagGraphPin::GetListContent()`. The `GameplayTagContainer` version of these functions in `Engine\Plugins\Editor\GameplayTagsEditor\Source\GameplayTagsEditor\Private\SGameplayTagContainerGraphPin.cpp` do not check for the meta field properties and pass along the filter.

The Sample Project extensively uses `GameplayTags`.

<a name="concepts-gt-change"></a>
### 4.2.1 Responding to Changes in Gameplay Tags
The `ASC` provides a delegate for when `GameplayTags` are added or removed. It takes in a `EGameplayTagEventType` that can specify only to fire when the `GameplayTag` is added/removed or for any change in the `GameplayTag's` `TagMapCount`.

```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->RegisterGameplayTagEvent(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag(FName("State.Debuff.Stun")), EGameplayTagEventType::NewOrRemoved).AddUObject(this, &AGDPlayerState::StunTagChanged);
```

The callback function has a parameter for the `GameplayTag` and the new `TagCount`.
```c++
virtual void StunTagChanged(const FGameplayTag CallbackTag, int32 NewCount);
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-a"></a>
### 4.3 Attributes

<a name="concepts-a-definition"></a>
#### 4.3.1 Attribute Definition
`Attributes` are float values defined by the struct [`FGameplayAttributeData`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/FGameplayAttributeData/index.html). These can represent anything from the amount of health a character has to the character's level to the number of charges that a potion has. If it is a gameplay-related numerical value belonging to an `Actor`, you should consider using an `Attribute` for it. `Attributes` should generally only be modified by [`GameplayEffects`](#concepts-ge) so that the ASC can [predict](#concepts-p) the changes.

`Attributes` are defined by and live in an [`AttributeSet`](#concepts-as). The `AttributeSet` is responsible for replicating `Attributes` that are marked for replication. See the section on [`AttributeSets`](#concepts-as) for how to define `Attributes`.

**Tip:** If you don't want an `Attribute` to show up in the Editor's list of `Attributes`, you can use the `Meta = (HideInDetailsView)` `property specifier`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-a-value"></a>
#### 4.3.2 BaseValue vs CurrentValue
An `Attribute` is composed of two values - a `BaseValue` and a `CurrentValue`. The `BaseValue` is the permanent value of the `Attribute` whereas the `CurrentValue` is the `BaseValue` plus temporary modifications from `GameplayEffects`. For example, your `Character` may have a movespeed `Attribute` with a `BaseValue` of 600 units/second. Since there are no `GameplayEffects` modifying the movespeed yet, the `CurrentValue` is also 600 u/s. If she gets a temporary 50 u/s movespeed buff, the `BaseValue` stays the same at 600 u/s while the `CurrentValue` is now 600 + 50 for a total of 650 u/s. When the movespeed buff expires, the `CurrentValue` reverts back to the `BaseValue` of 600 u/s.

Often beginners to GAS will confuse `BaseValue` with a maximum value for an `Attribute` and try to treat it as such. This is an incorrect approach. Maximum values for `Attributes` that can change or are referenced in abilities or UI should be treated as separate `Attributes`. For hardcoded maximum and minimum values, there is a way to define a `DataTable` with `FAttributeMetaData` that can set maximum and minimum values, but Epic's comment above the struct calls it a "work in progress". See `AttributeSet.h` for more information. To prevent confusion, I recommend that maximum values that can be referenced in abilities or UI be made as separate `Attributes` and hardcoded maximum and minimum values that are only used for clamping `Attributes` be defined as hardcoded floats in the `AttributeSet`. Clamping of `Attributes` is discussed in [PreAttributeChange()](#concepts-as-preattributechange) for changes to the `CurrentValue` and [PostGameplayEffectExecute()](#concepts-as-postgameplayeffectexecute) for changes to the `BaseValue` from `GameplayEffects`.

Permanent changes to the `BaseValue` come from `Instant` `GameplayEffects` whereas `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` change the `CurrentValue`. Periodic `GameplayEffects` are treated like instant `GameplayEffects` and change the `BaseValue`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-a-meta"></a>
#### 4.3.3 Meta Attributes
Some `Attributes` are treated as placeholders for temporary values that are intended to interact with `Attributes`. These are called `Meta Attributes`. For example, we commonly define damage as a `Meta Attribute`. Instead of a `GameplayEffect` directly changing our health `Attribute`, we use a `Meta Attribute` called damage as a placeholder. This way the damage value can be modified with buffs and debuffs in an [`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculation`](#concepts-ge-ec) and can be further manipulated in the `AttributeSet`, for example subtracting the damage from a current shield `Attribute`, before finally subtracting the remainder from the health `Attribute`. The damage `Meta Attribute` has no persistence between `GameplayEffects` and is overriden by every one. `Meta Attributes` are not typically replicated.

`Meta Attributes` provide a good logical separation for things like damage and healing between "How much damage did we do?" and "What do we do with this damage?". This logical separation means our `Gameplay Effects` and `Execution Calculations` don't need to know how the Target handles the damage. Continuing our damage example, the `Gameplay Effect` determines how much damage and then the `AttributeSet` decides what to do with that damage. Not all characters may have the same `Attributes`, especially if you use subclassed `AttributeSets`. The base `AttributeSet` class may only have a health `Attribute`, but a subclassed `AttributeSet` may add a shield `Attribute`. The subclassed `AttributeSet` with the shield `Attribute` would distribute the damage received differently than the base `AttributeSet` class.

While `Meta Attributes` are a good design pattern, they are not mandatory. If you only ever have one `Execution Calculation` used for all instances of damage and one `Attribute Set` class shared by all characters, then you may be fine doing the damage distribution to health, shields, etc. inside of the `Execution Calculation` and directly modifying those `Attributes`. You'll only be sacrificing flexibility, but that may be okay for you.

<a name="concepts-a-changes"></a>
#### 4.3.4 Responding to Attribute Changes
To listen for when an `Attribute` changes to update the UI or other gameplay, use `UAbilitySystemComponent::GetGameplayAttributeValueChangeDelegate(FGameplayAttribute Attribute)`. This function returns a delegate that you can bind to that will be automatically called whenever an `Attribute` changes. The delegate provides a `FOnAttributeChangeData` parameter with the `NewValue`, `OldValue`, and `FGameplayEffectModCallbackData`. **Note:** The `FGameplayEffectModCallbackData` will only be set on the server.

```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->GetGameplayAttributeValueChangeDelegate(AttributeSetBase->GetHealthAttribute()).AddUObject(this, &AGDPlayerState::HealthChanged);
```

```c++
virtual void HealthChanged(const FOnAttributeChangeData& Data);
```

The Sample Project binds to the `Attribute` value changed delegates on the `GDPlayerState` to update the HUD and to respond to player death when health reaches zero.

A custom Blueprint node that wraps this into an `ASyncTask` is included in the Sample Project. It is used in the `UI_HUD` UMG Widget to update the health, mana, and stamina values. This `AsyncTask` will live forever until manually called `EndTask()`, which we do in the UMG Widget's `Destruct` event. See `AsyncTaskAttributeChanged.h/cpp`.

![Listen for Attribute Change BP Node](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/attributechange.png)

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-a-derived"></a>
#### 4.3.5 Derived Attributes
To make an `Attribute` that has some or all of its value derived from one or more other `Attributes`, use an `Infinite` `GameplayEffect` with one or more `Attribute Based` or [`MMC`](#concepts-ge-mmc) [`Modifiers`](#concepts-ge-mods). The `Derived Attribute` will update automatically when an `Attribute` that it depends on is updated.

The final formula for all the `Modifiers` on a `Derived Attribute` is the same formula for `Modifier Aggregators`. If you need calculations to happen in a certain order, do it all inside of an `MMC`.

```
((CurrentValue + Additive) * Multiplicitive) / Division
```

**Note:** If playing with multiple clients in PIE, you need to disable `Run Under One Process` in the Editor Preferences otherwise the `Derived Attributes` will not update when their independent `Attributes` update on clients other than the first.

In this example, we have an `Infinite` `GameplayEffect` that derives the value of `TestAttrA` from the `Attributes`, `TestAttrB` and `TestAttrC`, in the formula `TestAttrA = (TestAttrA + TestAttrB) * ( 2 * TestAttrC)`. `TestAttrA` recalculates its value automatically whenever any of the `Attributes` update their values.

![Derived Attribute Example](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/derivedattribute.png)

### 4.4 Attribute Set

<a name="concepts-as-definition"></a>
#### 4.4.1 Attribute Set Definition
The `AttributeSet` defines, holds, and manages changes to `Attributes`. Developers should subclass from [`UAttributeSet`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/UAttributeSet/index.html). Creating an `AttributeSet` in an `OwnerActor's` constructor automatically registers it with its `ASC`. **This must be done in C++**.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-as-design"></a>
#### 4.4.2 Attribute Set Design
An `ASC` may have one or many `AttributeSets`. AttributeSets have negligible memory overhead so how many `AttributeSets` to use is an organizational decision left up to the developer.

It is acceptable to have one large monolithic `AttributeSet` shared by every `Actor` in your game and only use attributes if needed while ignoring unused attributes.

Alternatively, you may choose to have more than one `AttributeSet` representing groupings of `Attributes` that you selectively add to your `Actors` as needed. For example, you could have an `AttributeSet` for health related `Attributes`, an `AttributeSet` for mana related `Attributes`, and so on. In a MOBA game, heroes might need mana but minions might not. Therefore the heroes would get the mana `AttributeSet` and minions would not.

Additionally, `AttributeSets` can be subclassed as another means of selectively choosing which `Attributes` an `Actor` has. `Attributes` are internally referred to as `AttributeSetClassName.AttributeName`. When you subclass an `AttributeSet`, all of the `Attributes` from the parent class will still have the parent class's name as the prefix.

While you can have more than one `AttributeSet`, you should not have more than one `AttributeSet` of the same class on an `ASC`. If you have more than one `AttributeSet` from the same class, it won't know which `AttributeSet` to use and will just pick one.

<a name="concepts-as-design-subcomponents"></a>
##### 4.4.2.1 Subcomponents with Individual Attributes
In the scenario where you have multiple damageable components on a `Pawn` like individually damageable armor pieces, I recommend that if you know the maximum number of damageable components that a `Pawn` could have to make that many health `Attributes` on one `AttributeSet` - DamageableCompHealth0, DamageableCompHealth1, etc. to represent logical 'slots' for those damageable components. In your damageable component class instance, assign the slot number `Attribute` that can be read by `GameplayAbilities` or [`Executions`](#concepts-ge-ec) to know which `Attribute` to apply damage to. `Pawns` that have less than the maximum number or zero of damageable components are fine. Just because a `AttributeSet` has an `Attribute`, doesn't mean that you have to use it. Unused `Attributes` take up trivial amount of memory.

If your subcomponents need many `Attributes` each, there's potentially an unbounded number of subcomponents, the subcomponents can detach and be used by other players (e.g. weapons), or for any other reason this approach doesn't work for you, I'd recommend switching away from `Attributes` and instead store plain old floats on the components. See [Item Attributes](#concepts-as-design-itemattributes).

<a name="concepts-as-design-addremoveruntime"></a>
##### 4.4.2.2 Adding and Removing AttributeSets at Runtime
`AttributeSets` can be added and removed from an `ASC` at runtime; however, removing `AttributeSets` can be dangerous. For example, if an `AttributeSet` is removed on a client before the server and an `Attribute` value change is replicated to client, the `Attribute` won't find its `AttributeSet` and crash the game.

On weapon add to inventory:
```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->GetSpawnedAttributes_Mutable().AddUnique(WeaponAttributeSetPointer);
AbilitySystemComponent->ForceReplication();
```

On weapon remove from inventory:
```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->GetSpawnedAttributes_Mutable().Remove(WeaponAttributeSetPointer);
AbilitySystemComponent->ForceReplication();
```
<a name="concepts-as-design-itemattributes"></a>
##### 4.4.2.3 Item Attributes (Weapon Ammo)
There's a few ways to implement equippable items with `Attributes` (weapon ammo, armor durability, etc). All of these approaches store values directly on the item. This is necessary for items that can be equipped by more than one player over its lifetime.

> 1. Use plain floats on the item (**Recommended**)
> 1. Separate `AttributeSet` on the item
> 1. Separate `ASC` on the item

<a name="concepts-as-design-itemattributes-plainfloats"></a>
###### 4.4.2.3.1 Plain Floats on the Item
Instead of `Attributes`, store plain float values on the item class instance. Fortnite and [GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) handle gun ammo this way. For a gun, store the max clip size, current ammo in clip, reserve ammo, etc directly as replicated floats (`COND_OwnerOnly`) on the gun instance. If weapons share reserve ammo, you would move the reserve ammo onto the character as an `Attribute` in a shared ammo `AttributeSet` (reload abilities can use a `Cost GE` to pull from reserve ammo into the gun's float clip ammo). Since you're not using `Attributes` for current clip ammo, you will need to override some functions in `UGameplayAbility` to check and apply cost against the floats on the gun. Making the gun the `SourceObject` in the [`GameplayAbilitySpec`](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation#concepts-ga-spec) when granting the ability means you'll have access to the gun that granted the ability inside the ability.

To prevent the gun from replicating back the ammo amount and clobbering the local ammo amount during automatic fire, disable replication while the player has a `IsFiring` `GameplayTag` in `PreReplication()`. You're essentially doing your own local prediction here.

```c++
void AGSWeapon::PreReplication(IRepChangedPropertyTracker& ChangedPropertyTracker)
{
	Super::PreReplication(ChangedPropertyTracker);

	DOREPLIFETIME_ACTIVE_OVERRIDE(AGSWeapon, PrimaryClipAmmo, (IsValid(AbilitySystemComponent) && !AbilitySystemComponent->HasMatchingGameplayTag(WeaponIsFiringTag)));
	DOREPLIFETIME_ACTIVE_OVERRIDE(AGSWeapon, SecondaryClipAmmo, (IsValid(AbilitySystemComponent) && !AbilitySystemComponent->HasMatchingGameplayTag(WeaponIsFiringTag)));
}
```

Benefits:
1. Avoids limitations of using `AttributeSets` (see below)

Limitations:
1. Can not use existing `GameplayEffect` workflow (`Cost GEs` for ammo use, etc)
1. Requires work to override key functions on `UGameplayAbility` to check and apply ammo costs against the gun's floats

###### 4.4.2.3.2 `AttributeSet` on the Item
Using a separate `AttributeSet` on the item that gets [added to the player's `ASC` on adding it to the player's inventory](#concepts-as-design-addremoveruntime) can work, but it has some major limitations. I had this working in early versions of [GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) for the weapon ammo. The weapon stores its `Attributes` such as max clip size, current ammo in clip, reserve ammo, etc in an `AttributeSet` that lives on the weapon class. If weapons share reserve ammo, you would move the reserve ammo onto the character in a shared ammo `AttributeSet`. When a weapon is added to the player's inventory on the server, the weapon would add its `AttributeSet` to the player's `ASC::SpawnedAttributes`. The server would then replicate this down to the client. If the weapon is removed from the inventory, it would remove its `AttributeSet` from the `ASC::SpawnedAttributes`.

When the `AttributeSet` lives on something other than the `OwnerActor` (say a weapon), you'll initially get some compilation errors in the `AttributeSet`. The fix is to construct the `AttributeSet` in `BeginPlay()` instead of in the constructor and to implement `IAbilitySystemInterface` (set the pointer to the `ASC` when you add the weapon to the player inventory) on the weapon.

```c++
void AGSWeapon::BeginPlay()
{
	if (!AttributeSet)
	{
		AttributeSet = NewObject<UGSWeaponAttributeSet>(this);
	}
	//...
}
```

You can see it in practice by checking out this [older version of GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter/tree/df5949d0dd992bd3d76d4a728f370f2e2c827735).

Benefits:
1. Can use existing `GameplayAbility` and `GameplayEffect` workflow (`Cost GEs` for ammo use, etc)
1. Simple to setup for a very small set of items

Limitations:
1. You have to make a new `AttributeSet` class for every weapon type. `ASCs` can only functionally have one `AttributeSet` instance of a class since changes to an `Attribute` look for the first instance of their `AttributeSet` class in the `ASCs` `SpawnedAttributes` array. Additional instances of the same `AttributeSet` class are ignored.
1. You can only have one of each type of weapon in the player's inventory due to previous reason of one `AttributeSet` instance per `AttributeSet` class.
1. Removing an `AttributeSet` is dangerous. In GASShooter if the player killed himself from a rocket, the player would immediately remove the rocket launcher from his inventory (including its `AttributeSet` from the `ASC`). When the server replicated that the rocket launcher's ammo `Attribute` changed, the `AttributeSet` no longer existed on the client's `ASC` and the game crashed.

<a name="concepts-as-design-itemattributes-asc"></a>
###### 4.4.2.3.3 `ASC` on the Item
Putting a whole `AbilitySystemComponent` on each item is an extreme approach. I have not personally done this nor have I seen it in the wild. It would take a lot of engineering to make it work.

> Is it viable to have several AbilitySystemComponents which have the same owner but different avatars (e.g. on pawn and weapon/items/projectiles with Owner set to PlayerState)?
> 
> The first problem I see there would be implementing the IGameplayTagAssetInterface and IAbilitySystemInterface on the owning actor. The former may be possible: just aggregate the tags from all all ASCs (but watch out -HasAllMatchingGameplayTags may be met only via cross ASC aggregation. It wouldn't be enough to just forward that calls to each ASC and OR the results together). But the later is even trickier: which ASC is the authoritative one? If someone wants to apply a GE -which one should receive it? Maybe you can work these out but this side of the problem will be the hardest: owners will have multiple ASCs beneath them.
> 
> Separate ASCs on the pawn and the weapon can make sense on its own though. E.g, distinguishing between tags that describe the weapon vs those that describe the owning pawn. Maybe it does make sense that tags granted to the weapon also “apply” to the owner and nothing else (e.g, attributes and GEs are independent but the owner will aggregate the owned tags like I describe above). This could work out, I am sure. But having multiple ASCs with the same owner may get dicey.

Benefits:
1. Can use existing `GameplayAbility` and `GameplayEffect` workflow (`Cost GEs` for ammo use, etc)
1. Can reuse `AttributeSet` classes (one on each weapon's ASC)

Limitations:
1. Unknown engineering cost
1. Is it even possible?

<a name="concepts-as-attributes"></a>
#### 4.4.3 Defining Attributes
**`Attributes` can only be defined in C++** in the `AttributeSet's` header file. It is recommended to add this block of macros to the top of every `AttributeSet` header file. It will automatically generate getter and setter functions for your `Attributes`.

```c++
// Uses macros from AttributeSet.h
#define ATTRIBUTE_ACCESSORS(ClassName, PropertyName) \
	GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_PROPERTY_GETTER(ClassName, PropertyName) \
	GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_VALUE_GETTER(PropertyName) \
	GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_VALUE_SETTER(PropertyName) \
	GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_VALUE_INITTER(PropertyName)
```

A replicated health attribute would be defined like this:

```c++
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Health", ReplicatedUsing = OnRep_Health)
FGameplayAttributeData Health;
ATTRIBUTE_ACCESSORS(UGDAttributeSetBase, Health)
```

Also define the `OnRep` function in the header:
```c++
UFUNCTION()
virtual void OnRep_Health(const FGameplayAttributeData& OldHealth);
```

The .cpp file for the `AttributeSet` should fill in the `OnRep` function with the `GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY` macro used by the prediction system:
```c++
void UGDAttributeSetBase::OnRep_Health(const FGameplayAttributeData& OldHealth)
{
	GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY(UGDAttributeSetBase, Health, OldHealth);
}
```

Finally, the `Attribute` needs to be added to `GetLifetimeReplicatedProps`:
```c++
void UGDAttributeSetBase::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(TArray<FLifetimeProperty>& OutLifetimeProps) const
{
	Super::GetLifetimeReplicatedProps(OutLifetimeProps);

	DOREPLIFETIME_CONDITION_NOTIFY(UGDAttributeSetBase, Health, COND_None, REPNOTIFY_Always);
}
```

`REPNOTIFY_Always` tells the `OnRep` function to trigger if the local value is already equal to the value being repped down from the Server (due to prediction). By default it won't trigger the `OnRep` function if the local value is the same as the value being repped down from the Server.

If the `Attribute` is not replicated like a `Meta Attribute`, then the `OnRep` and `GetLifetimeReplicatedProps` steps can be skipped.

<a name="concepts-as-init"></a>
#### 4.4.4 Initializing Attributes
There are multiple ways to initialize `Attributes` (set their `BaseValue` and consequently their `CurrentValue` to some initial value). Epic recommends using an instant `GameplayEffect`. This is the method used in the Sample Project too.

See `GE_HeroAttributes` Blueprint in the Sample Project for how to make an instant `GameplayEffect` to initialize `Attributes`. Application of this `GameplayEffect` happens in C++.

If you used the `ATTRIBUTE_ACCESSORS` macro when you defined your `Attributes`, an initialization function will automatically be generated on the `AttributeSet` for each `Attribute` that you can call at your leisure in C++.

```c++
// InitHealth(float InitialValue) is an automatically generated function for an Attribute 'Health' defined with the `ATTRIBUTE_ACCESSORS` macro
AttributeSet->InitHealth(100.0f);
```

See `AttributeSet.h` for more ways to initialize `Attributes`.

**Note:** Prior to 4.24, `FAttributeSetInitterDiscreteLevels` did not work with `FGameplayAttributeData`. It was created when `Attributes` were raw floats and will complain about `FGameplayAttributeData` not being `Plain Old Data` (`POD`). This is fixed in 4.24 https://issues.unrealengine.com/issue/UE-76557.

<a name="concepts-as-preattributechange"></a>
#### 4.4.5 PreAttributeChange()
`PreAttributeChange(const FGameplayAttribute& Attribute, float& NewValue)` is one of the main functions in the `AttributeSet` to respond to changes to an `Attribute's` `CurrentValue` before the change happens. It is the ideal place to clamp incoming changes to `CurrentValue` via the reference parameter `NewValue`.

For example to clamp movespeed modifiers the Sample Project does it like so:
```c++
if (Attribute == GetMoveSpeedAttribute())
{
	// Cannot slow less than 150 units/s and cannot boost more than 1000 units/s
	NewValue = FMath::Clamp<float>(NewValue, 150, 1000);
}
```
The `GetMoveSpeedAttribute()` function is created by the macro block that we added to the `AttributeSet.h` ([Defining Attributes](#concepts-as-attributes)).

This is triggered from any changes to `Attributes`, whether using `Attribute` setters (defined by the macro block in `AttributeSet.h` ([Defining Attributes](#concepts-as-attributes))) or using [`GameplayEffects`](#concepts-ge).

**Note:** Any clamping that happens here does not permanently change the modifier on the `ASC`. It only changes the value returned from querying the modifier. This means anything that recalculates the `CurrentValue` from all of the modifiers like [`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculations`](#concepts-ge-ec) and [`ModifierMagnitudeCalculations`](#concepts-ge-mmc) need to implement clamping again.

**Note:** Epic's comments for `PreAttributeChange()` say not to use it for gameplay events and instead use it mainly for clamping. The recommended place for gameplay events on `Attribute` change is `UAbilitySystemComponent::GetGameplayAttributeValueChangeDelegate(FGameplayAttribute Attribute)` ([Responding to Attribute Changes](#concepts-a-changes)).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-as-postgameplayeffectexecute"></a>
#### 4.4.6 PostGameplayEffectExecute()
`PostGameplayEffectExecute(const FGameplayEffectModCallbackData & Data)` only triggers after changes to the `BaseValue` of an `Attribute` from an instant [`GameplayEffect`](#concepts-ge). This is a valid place to do more `Attribute` manipulation when they change from a `GameplayEffect`.

For example, in the Sample Project we subtract the final damage `Meta Attribute` from the health `Attribute` here. If there was a shield `Attribute`, we would subtract the damage from it first before subtracting the remainder from health. The Sample Project also uses this location to apply hit react animations, show floating Damage Numbers, and assign experience and gold bounties to the killer. By design, the damage `Meta Attribute` will always come through an instant `GameplayEffect` and never the `Attribute` setter.

Other `Attributes` that will only have their `BaseValue` changed from instant `GameplayEffects` like mana and stamina can also be clamped to their maximum value counterpart `Attributes` here.

**Note:** When `PostGameplayEffectExecute()` is called, changes to the `Attribute` have already happened, but they have not replicated back to clients yet so clamping values here will not cause two network updates to clients. Clients will only receive the update after clamping.

<a name="concepts-as-onattributeaggregatorcreated"></a>
#### 4.4.7 OnAttributeAggregatorCreated()
`OnAttributeAggregatorCreated(const FGameplayAttribute& Attribute, FAggregator* NewAggregator)` triggers when an `Aggregator` is created for an `Attribute` in this set. It allows custom setup of [`FAggregatorEvaluateMetaData`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/FAggregatorEvaluateMetaData/index.html). `AggregatorEvaluateMetaData` is used by the `Aggregator` in evaluating the `CurrentValue` of an `Attribute` based on all the [`Modifiers`](#concepts-ge-mods) applied to it. By default, `AggregatorEvaluateMetaData` is only used by the `Aggregator` to determine which `Modifiers` qualify with the example of `MostNegativeMod_AllPositiveMods` which allows all positive `Modifiers` but restricts negative `Modifiers` to only the most negative one. This was used by Paragon to only allow the most negative move speed slow effect to apply to a player regardless of how many slow effects where on them at any one time while applying all positive move speed buffs. `Modifiers` that don't qualify still exist on the `ASC`, they just aren't aggregated into the final `CurrentValue`. They can potentially qualify later once conditions change, like in the case if the most negative `Modifier` expires, the next most negative `Modifier` (if one exists) then qualifies.

To use AggregatorEvaluateMetaData in the example of only allowing the most negative `Modifier` and all positive `Modifiers`:

```c++
virtual void OnAttributeAggregatorCreated(const FGameplayAttribute& Attribute, FAggregator* NewAggregator) const override;
```

```c++
void UGSAttributeSetBase::OnAttributeAggregatorCreated(const FGameplayAttribute& Attribute, FAggregator* NewAggregator) const
{
	Super::OnAttributeAggregatorCreated(Attribute, NewAggregator);

	if (!NewAggregator)
	{
		return;
	}

	if (Attribute == GetMoveSpeedAttribute())
	{
		NewAggregator->EvaluationMetaData = &FAggregatorEvaluateMetaDataLibrary::MostNegativeMod_AllPositiveMods;
	}
}
```

Your custom `AggregatorEvaluateMetaData` for qualifiers should be added to `FAggregatorEvaluateMetaDataLibrary` as static variables.

### 4.5 Gameplay Effects

<a name="concepts-ge-definition"></a>
#### 4.5.1 Gameplay Effect Definition
[`GameplayEffects`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/UGameplayEffect/index.html) (`GE`) are the vessels through which abilities change [`Attributes`](#concepts-a) and [`GameplayTags`](#concepts-gt) on themselves and others. They can cause immediate `Attribute` changes like damage or healing or apply long term status buff/debuffs like a movespeed boost or stunning. The `UGameplayEffect` class is a meant to be a **data-only** class that defines a single gameplay effect. No additional logic should be added to `GameplayEffects`. Typically designers will create many Blueprint child classes of `UGameplayEffect`.

`GameplayEffects` change `Attributes` through [`Modifiers`](#concepts-ge-mods) and [`Executions` (`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculation`)](#concepts-ge-ec).

`GameplayEffects` have three types of duration: `Instant`, `Duration`, and `Infinite`.

Additionally, `GameplayEffects` can add/execute [`GameplayCues`](#concepts-gc). An `Instant` `GameplayEffect` will call `Execute` on the `GameplayCue` `GameplayTags` whereas a `Duration` or `Infinite` `GameplayEffect` will call `Add` and `Remove` on the `GameplayCue` `GameplayTags`.

| Duration Type | GameplayCue Event | When to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Instant`     | Execute           | For immediate permanent changes to `Attribute's` `BaseValue`. `GameplayTags` will not be applied, not even for a frame.                                                                                                                    |
| `Duration`    | Add & Remove      | For temporary changes to `Attribute's` `CurrentValue` and to apply `GameplayTags` that will be removed when the `GameplayEffect` expires or is manually removed. The duration is specified in the `UGameplayEffect` class/Blueprint.       |
| `Infinite`    | Add & Remove      | For temporary changes to `Attribute's` `CurrentValue` and to apply `GameplayTags` that will be removed when the `GameplayEffect` is removed. These will never expire on their own and must be manually removed by an ability or the `ASC`. |

`Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` have the option of applying `Periodic Effects` that apply its `Modifiers` and `Executions` every `X` seconds as defined by its `Period`. `Periodic Effects` are treated as `Instant` `GameplayEffects` when it comes to changing the `Attribute's` `BaseValue` and `Executing` `GameplayCues`. These are useful for damage over time (DOT) type effects. **Note:** `Periodic Effects` cannot be [predicted](#concepts-p).

`Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` can be temporarily turned off and on after application if their `Ongoing Tag Requirements` are not met/met ([Gameplay Effect Tags](#concepts-ge-tags)). Turning off a `GameplayEffect` removes the effects of its `Modifiers` and applied `GameplayTags` but does not remove the `GameplayEffect`. Turning the `GameplayEffect` back on reapplies its `Modifiers` and `GameplayTags`.

If you need to manually recalculate the `Modifiers` of a `Duration` or `Infinite` `GameplayEffect` (say you have an `MMC` that uses data that doesn't come from `Attributes`), you can call `UAbilitySystemComponent::ActiveGameplayEffects.SetActiveGameplayEffectLevel(FActiveGameplayEffectHandle ActiveHandle, int32 NewLevel)` with the same level that it already has using `UAbilitySystemComponent::ActiveGameplayEffects.GetActiveGameplayEffect(ActiveHandle).Spec.GetLevel()`. `Modifiers` that are based on backing `Attributes` automatically update when those backing `Attributes` update. The key functions of `SetActiveGameplayEffectLevel()` to update the `Modifiers` are:

```C++
MarkItemDirty(Effect);
Effect.Spec.CalculateModifierMagnitudes();
// Private function otherwise we'd call these three functions without needing to set the level to what it already is
UpdateAllAggregatorModMagnitudes(Effect);
```

`GameplayEffects` are not typically instantiated. When an ability or `ASC` wants to apply a `GameplayEffect`, it creates a [`GameplayEffectSpec`](#concepts-ge-spec) from the `GameplayEffect's` `ClassDefaultObject`. Successfully applied `GameplayEffectSpecs` are then added to a new struct called `FActiveGameplayEffect` which is what the `ASC` keeps track of in a special container struct called `ActiveGameplayEffects`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ge-applying"></a>
#### 4.5.2 Applying Gameplay Effects
`GameplayEffects` can be applied in many ways from functions on [`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) and functions on the `ASC` and usually take the form of `ApplyGameplayEffectTo`. The different functions are essentially convenience functions that will eventually call `UAbilitySystemComponent::ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToSelf()` on the `Target`.

To apply `GameplayEffects` outside of a `GameplayAbility` for example from a projectile, you need to get the `Target's` `ASC` and use one of its functions to `ApplyGameplayEffectToSelf`.

You can listen for when any `Duration` or `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` are applied to an `ASC` by binding to its delegate:
```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->OnActiveGameplayEffectAddedDelegateToSelf.AddUObject(this, &APACharacterBase::OnActiveGameplayEffectAddedCallback);
```
The callback function:
```c++
virtual void OnActiveGameplayEffectAddedCallback(UAbilitySystemComponent* Target, const FGameplayEffectSpec& SpecApplied, FActiveGameplayEffectHandle ActiveHandle);
```

The server will always call this function regardless of replication mode. The autonomous proxy will only call this for replicated `GameplayEffects` in `Full` and `Mixed` replication modes. Simulated proxies will only call this in `Full` [replication mode](#concepts-asc-rm).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ga-removing"></a>
#### 4.5.3 Removing Gameplay Effects
`GameplayEffects` can be removed in many ways from functions on [`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) and functions on the `ASC` and usually take the form of `RemoveActiveGameplayEffect`. The different functions are essentially convenience functions that will eventually call `FActiveGameplayEffectsContainer::RemoveActiveEffects()` on the `Target`.

To remove `GameplayEffects` outside of a `GameplayAbility`, you need to get the `Target's` `ASC` and use one of its functions to `RemoveActiveGameplayEffect`.

You can listen for when any `Duration` or `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` are removed from an `ASC` by binding to its delegate:
```c++
AbilitySystemComponent->OnAnyGameplayEffectRemovedDelegate().AddUObject(this, &APACharacterBase::OnRemoveGameplayEffectCallback);
```
The callback function:
```c++
virtual void OnRemoveGameplayEffectCallback(const FActiveGameplayEffect& EffectRemoved);
```

The server will always call this function regardless of replication mode. The autonomous proxy will only call this for replicated `GameplayEffects` in `Full` and `Mixed` replication modes. Simulated proxies will only call this in `Full` [replication mode](#concepts-asc-rm).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ge-mods"></a>
#### 4.5.4 Gameplay Effect Modifiers
`Modifiers` change an `Attribute` and are the only way to [predictively](#concepts-p) change an `Attribute`. A `GameplayEffect` can have zero or many `Modifiers`. Each `Modifier` is responsible for changing only one `Attribute` via a specified operation.

| Operation  | Description                                                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Add`      | Adds the result to the `Modifier's` specified `Attribute`. Use a negative value for subtraction. |
| `Multiply` | Multiplies the result to the `Modifier's` specified `Attribute`.                                 |
| `Divide`   | Divides the result against the `Modifier's` specified `Attribute`.                               |
| `Override` | Overrides the `Modifier's` specified `Attribute` with the result.                                |

The `CurrentValue` of an `Attribute` is the aggregate result of all of its `Modifiers` added to its `BaseValue`. The formula for how `Modifiers` are aggregated is defined as follows in `FAggregatorModChannel::EvaluateWithBase` in `GameplayEffectAggregator.cpp`:
```c++
((InlineBaseValue + Additive) * Multiplicitive) / Division
```

Any `Override` `Modifiers` will override the final value with the last applied `Modifier` taking precedence.

**Note:** For percentage based changes, make sure to use the `Multiply` operation so that it happens after addition.

**Note:** [Prediction](#concepts-p) has trouble with percentage changes.

There are four types of `Modifiers`: Scalable Float, Attribute Based, Custom Calculation Class, and Set By Caller. They all generate some float value that is then used to change the specified `Attribute` of the `Modifier` based on its operation.

| `Modifier` Type            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Scalable Float`           | `FScalableFloats` are a structure that can point to a Data Table that has the variables as rows and levels as columns. The Scalable Floats will automatically read the value of the specified table row at the ability's current level (or different level if overriden on the [`GameplayEffectSpec`](#concepts-ge-spec)). This value can further be manipulated by a coefficient. If no Data Table/Row is specified, it treats the value as a 1 so the coefficient can be used to hard code in a single value at all levels. ![ScalableFloat](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/scalablefloats.png)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| `Set By Caller`            | `SetByCaller` `Modifiers` are values that are set outside of the `GameplayEffect` at runtime by the ability or whoever made the `GameplayEffectSpec` on the `GameplayEffectSpec`. For example, you would use a `SetByCaller` if you want to set the damage to be based on how long the player held down a button to charge the ability. `SetByCallers` are essentially `TMap<FGameplayTag, float>` that live on the `GameplayEffectSpec`. The `Modifier` is just telling the `Aggregator` to look for a `SetByCaller` value associated with the supplied `GameplayTag`. The `SetByCallers` used by `Modifiers` can only use the `GameplayTag` version of the concept. The `FName` version is disabled here. If the `Modifier` is set to `SetByCaller` but a `SetByCaller` with the correct `GameplayTag` does not exist on the `GameplayEffectSpec`, the game will throw a runtime error and return a value of 0. This might cause issues in the case of a `Divide` operation. See [`SetByCallers`](#concepts-ge-spec-setbycaller) for more information on how to use `SetByCallers`. |

<a name="concepts-ge-mods-multiplydivide"></a>
##### 4.5.4.1 Multiply and Divide Modifiers
By default, all `Multiply` and `Divide` `Modifiers` are added together before multiplying or dividing them into the `Attribute`'s `BaseValue`.

```c++
float FAggregatorModChannel::EvaluateWithBase(float InlineBaseValue, const FAggregatorEvaluateParameters& Parameters) const
{
	...
	float Additive = SumMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Additive], GameplayEffectUtilities::GetModifierBiasByModifierOp(EGameplayModOp::Additive), Parameters);
	float Multiplicitive = SumMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Multiplicitive], GameplayEffectUtilities::GetModifierBiasByModifierOp(EGameplayModOp::Multiplicitive), Parameters);
	float Division = SumMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Division], GameplayEffectUtilities::GetModifierBiasByModifierOp(EGameplayModOp::Division), Parameters);
	...
	return ((InlineBaseValue + Additive) * Multiplicitive) / Division;
	...
}
```

```c++
float FAggregatorModChannel::SumMods(const TArray<FAggregatorMod>& InMods, float Bias, const FAggregatorEvaluateParameters& Parameters)
{
	float Sum = Bias;

	for (const FAggregatorMod& Mod : InMods)
	{
		if (Mod.Qualifies())
		{
			Sum += (Mod.EvaluatedMagnitude - Bias);
		}
	}

	return Sum;
}
```
*from `GameplayEffectAggregator.cpp`*

Both `Multiply` and `Divide` `Modifiers` have a `Bias` value of `1` in this formula (`Addition` has a `Bias` of `0`). So it would look something like:

```
1 + (Mod1.Magnitude - 1) + (Mod2.Magnitude - 1) + ...
```

This formula leads to some unexpected results. Firstly, this formula adds all the modifiers together before multiplying or dividing them into the `BaseValue`. Most people would expect it to multiply or divide them together. For example, if you have two `Multiply` modifiers of `1.5`, most people would expect the `BaseValue` to be multiplied by `1.5 x 1.5 = 2.25`. Instead, this adds the `1.5`s together to multiply the `BaseValue` by `2` (`50% increase + another 50% increase = 100% increase`). This was for the example from `GameplayPrediction.h` of a `10%` speed buff on `500` base speed would be `550`. Add another `10%` speed buff and it will be `600`.

Secondly, this formula has some undocumented rules about what values can be used as it was designed with Paragon in mind.

Rules for `Multiply` and `Divide` multiplication addition formula:
* `(No more than one value < 1) AND (Any number of values [1, 2))`
* `OR (One value >= 2)`

The `Bias` in the formula basically subtracts out the integer digit of numbers in the range `[1, 2)`. The first `Modifier`'s `Bias` subtracts out from the starting `Sum` value (set to the `Bias` before the loop) which is why any value by itself works and why one value `< 1` will work with the numbers in the range `[1, 2)`.

Some examples with `Multiply`:  
Multipliers: `0.5`  
`1 + (0.5 - 1) = 0.5`, correct

Multipliers: `0.5, 0.5`  
`1 + (0.5 - 1) + (0.5 - 1) = 0`, incorrect expected `1`? Multiple values less than `1` don't make sense for adding multipliers. Paragon was designed to only use the [greatest negative value for `Multiply` `Modifiers`](#cae-nonstackingge) so there would only ever be at most one value less than `1` multiplying into the `BaseValue`.

Multipliers: `1.1, 0.5`  
`1 + (0.5 - 1) + (1.1 - 1) = 0.6`, correct

Multipliers: `5, 5`  
`1 + (5 - 1) + (5 - 1) = 9`, incorrect expected `10`. Will always be the `sum of the Modifiers - number of Modifiers + 1`.

Many games will want their `Multiply` and `Divide` `Modifiers` to multiply and divide together before applying to the `BaseValue`. To achieve this, you will need to **change the engine code** for `FAggregatorModChannel::EvaluateWithBase()`.

```c++
float FAggregatorModChannel::EvaluateWithBase(float InlineBaseValue, const FAggregatorEvaluateParameters& Parameters) const
{
	...
	float Multiplicitive = MultiplyMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Multiplicitive], Parameters);
	float Division = MultiplyMods(Mods[EGameplayModOp::Division], Parameters);
	...

	return ((InlineBaseValue + Additive) * Multiplicitive) / Division;
}
```

```c++
float FAggregatorModChannel::MultiplyMods(const TArray<FAggregatorMod>& InMods, const FAggregatorEvaluateParameters& Parameters)
{
	float Multiplier = 1.0f;

	for (const FAggregatorMod& Mod : InMods)
	{
		if (Mod.Qualifies())
		{
			Multiplier *= Mod.EvaluatedMagnitude;
		}
	}

	return Multiplier;
}
```

<a name="concepts-ge-mods-gameplaytags"></a>
##### 4.5.4.2 Gameplay Tags on Modifiers

`SourceTags` and `TargetTags` can be set for each [Modifier](#concepts-ge-mods). They work the same like the [`Application Tag requirements`](#concepts-ge-tags) of a `GameplayEffect`. So the tags are considered only when the effect is applied. I.e. when having a periodic, infinite effect, they are only taken into consideration on the first application of the effect but *not* on each periodic execution.

`Attribute Based` Modifiers can also set `SourceTagFilter` and `TargetTagFilter`. When determining the magnitude of the attribute which is the source of the `Attribute Based` Modifier, these filters are used to exclude certain Modifiers to that attribute. Modifiers which source or target didn't have all of the tags of the filter are excluded.

This means in detail: The tags of the source ASC and the target ASC are captured by `GameplayEffects`. The source ASC tags are captured, when the `GameplayEffectSpec` is created, the target ASC tags are captured on execution of the effect. When determining, if a Modifier of an infinite or duration effect "qualifies" to be applied (i.e. its Aggregator qualifies) and those filters are set, the captured tags are compared against the filters.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ge-stacking"></a>
#### 4.5.5 Stacking Gameplay Effects
`GameplayEffects` by default will apply new instances of the `GameplayEffectSpec` that don't know or care about previously existing instances of the `GameplayEffectSpec` on application. `GameplayEffects` can be set to stack where instead of a new instance of the `GameplayEffectSpec` is added, the currently existing `GameplayEffectSpec's` stack count is changed. Stacking only works for `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects`.

There are two types of stacking: Aggregate by Source and Aggregate by Target.

| Stacking Type       | Description                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Aggregate by Source | There is a separate instance of stacks per Source `ASC` on the Target. Each Source can apply X amount of stacks.                     |
| Aggregate by Target | There is only one instance of stacks on the Target regardless of Source. Each Source can apply a stack up to the shared stack limit. |

Stacks also have policies for expiration, duration refresh, and period reset. They have helpful hover tooltips in the `GameplayEffect` Blueprint.

The Sample Project includes a custom Blueprint node that listens for `GameplayEffect` stack changes. The HUD UMG Widget uses it to update the amount of passive armor stacks that the player has. This `AsyncTask` will live forever until manually called `EndTask()`, which we do in the UMG Widget's `Destruct` event. See `AsyncTaskEffectStackChanged.h/cpp`.

<a name="concepts-ge-ga"></a>
#### 4.5.6 Granted Abilities
`GameplayEffects` can grant new [`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) to `ASCs`. Only `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` can grant abilities.

A common usecase for this is when you want to force another player to do something like moving them from a knockback or pull. You would apply a `GameplayEffect` to them that grants them an automatically activating ability (see [Passive Abilities](#concepts-ga-activating-passive) for how to automatically activate an ability when it is granted) that does the desired action to them.

Designers can choose which abilities a `GameplayEffect` grants, what level to grant them at, what [input to bind](#concepts-ga-input) them at and the removal policy for the granted ability.

| Removal Policy             | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cancel Ability Immediately | The granted ability is canceled and removed immediately when the `GameplayEffect` that granted it is removed from the Target.                                                   |
| Remove Ability on End      | The granted ability is allowed to finish and then is removed from the Target.                                                                                                   |
| Do Nothing                 | The granted ability is not affected by the removal of the granting `GameplayEffect` from the Target. The Target has the ability permanently until it is manually removed later. |

<a name="concepts-ge-tags"></a>
#### 4.5.7 Gameplay Effect Tags
`GameplayEffects` carry multiple [`GameplayTagContainers`](#concepts-gt). Designers will edit the `Added` and `Removed` `GameplayTagContainers` for each category and the result will show up in the `Combined` `GameplayTagContainer` on compilation. `Added` tags are new tags that this `GameplayEffect` adds that its parents did not previously have. `Removed` tags are tags that parent classes have but this subclass does not have.

| Category                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Gameplay Effect Asset Tags        | Tags that the `GameplayEffect` has. They do not do any function on their own and serve only the purpose of describing the `GameplayEffect`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Granted Tags                      | Tags that live on the `GameplayEffect` but are also given to the `ASC` that the `GameplayEffect` is applied to. They are removed from the `ASC` when the `GameplayEffect` is removed. This only works for `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects`.                                                                                                                             |
| Ongoing Tag Requirements          | Once applied, these tags determine whether the `GameplayEffect` is on or off. A `GameplayEffect` can be off and still be applied. If a `GameplayEffect` is off due to failing the Ongoing Tag Requirements, but the requirements are then met, the `GameplayEffect` will turn on again and reapply its modifiers. This only works for `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects`. |
| Application Tag Requirements      | Tags on the Target that determine if a `GameplayEffect` can be applied to the Target. If these requirements are not met, the `GameplayEffect` is not applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Remove Gameplay Effects with Tags | `GameplayEffects` on the Target that have any of these tags in their `Asset Tags` or `Granted Tags` will be removed from the Target when this `GameplayEffect` is successfully applied.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

<a name="concepts-ge-immunity"></a>
#### 4.5.8 Immunity
`GameplayEffects` can grant immunity, effectively blocking the application of other `GameplayEffects`, based on [`GameplayTags`](#concepts-gt). While immunity can be effectively achieved through other means like `Application Tag Requirements`, using this system provides a delegate for when `GameplayEffects` are blocked due to immunity `UAbilitySystemComponent::OnImmunityBlockGameplayEffectDelegate`.

`GrantedApplicationImmunityTags` checks if the Source `ASC` (including tags from the Source ability's `AbilityTags` if there was one) has any of the specified tags. This is a way to provide immunity from all `GameplayEffects` from certain characters or sources based on their tags.

`Granted Application Immunity Query` checks the incoming `GameplayEffectSpec` if it matches any of the queries to block or allow its application.

The queries have helpful hover tooltips in the `GameplayEffect` Blueprint.

<a name="concepts-ge-spec"></a>
#### 4.5.9 Gameplay Effect Spec
The [`GameplayEffectSpec`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/FGameplayEffectSpec/index.html) (`GESpec`) can be thought of as the instantiations of `GameplayEffects`. They hold a reference to the `GameplayEffect` class that they represent, what level it was created at, and who created it. These can be freely created and modified at runtime before application unlike `GameplayEffects` which should be created by designers prior to runtime. When applying a `GameplayEffect`, a `GameplayEffectSpec` is created from the `GameplayEffect` and that is actually what is applied to the Target.

`GameplayEffectSpecs` are created from `GameplayEffects` using `UAbilitySystemComponent::MakeOutgoingSpec()` which is `BlueprintCallable`. `GameplayEffectSpecs` do not have to be immediately applied. It is common to pass a `GameplayEffectSpec` to a projectile created from an ability that the projectile can apply to the target it hits later. When `GameplayEffectSpecs` are successfully applied, they return a new struct called `FActiveGameplayEffect`.

Notable `GameplayEffectSpec` Contents:
* The `GameplayEffect` class that this `GameplayEffect` was created from.
* The level of this `GameplayEffectSpec`. Usually the same as the level of the ability that created the `GameplayEffectSpec` but can be different.
* The duration of the `GameplayEffectSpec`. Defaults to the duration of the `GameplayEffect` but can be different.
* The period of the `GameplayEffectSpec` for periodic effects. Defaults to the period of the `GameplayEffect` but can be different.
* The current stack count of this `GameplayEffectSpec`. The stack limit is on the `GameplayEffect`.
* The [`GameplayEffectContextHandle`](#concepts-ge-context) tells us who created this `GameplayEffectSpec`.
* `Attributes` that were captured at the time of the `GameplayEffectSpec`'s creation due to snapshotting.
* `DynamicGrantedTags` that the `GameplayEffectSpec` grants to the Target in addition to the `GameplayTags` that the `GameplayEffect` grants.
* `DynamicAssetTags` that the `GameplayEffectSpec` has in addition to the `AssetTags` that the `GameplayEffect` has.
* `SetByCaller` `TMaps`.

<a name="concepts-ge-spec-setbycaller"></a>
##### 4.5.9.1 SetByCallers
`SetByCallers` allow the `GameplayEffectSpec` to carry float values associated with a `GameplayTag` or `FName` around. They are stored in their respective `TMaps`: `TMap<FGameplayTag, float>` and `TMap<FName, float>` on the `GameplayEffectSpec`. These can be used as `Modifiers` on the `GameplayEffect` or as generic means of ferrying floats around. It is common to pass numerical data generated inside of an ability to [`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculations`](#concepts-ge-ec) or [`ModifierMagnitudeCalculations`](#concepts-ge-mmc) via `SetByCallers`.

| `SetByCaller` Use | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `Modifiers`       | Must be defined ahead of time in the `GameplayEffect` class. Can only use the `GameplayTag` version. If one is defined on the `GameplayEffect` class but the `GameplayEffectSpec` does not have the corresponding tag and float value pair, the game will have a runtime error on application of the `GameplayEffectSpec` and return 0. This is a potential problem for a `Divide` operation. See [`Modifiers`](#concepts-ge-mods). |
| Elsewhere         | Does not need to be defined ahead of time anywhere. Reading a `SetByCaller` that does not exist on a `GameplayEffectSpec` can return a developer defined default value with optional warnings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

To assign `SetByCaller` values in Blueprint, use the Blueprint node for the version that you need (`GameplayTag` or `FName`):

![Assigning SetByCaller](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/setbycaller.png)

To read a `SetByCaller` value in Blueprint, you will need to make custom nodes in your Blueprint Library.

To assign `SetByCaller` values in C++, use the version of the function that you need (`GameplayTag` or `FName`):

```c++
void FGameplayEffectSpec::SetSetByCallerMagnitude(FName DataName, float Magnitude);
```
```c++
void FGameplayEffectSpec::SetSetByCallerMagnitude(FGameplayTag DataTag, float Magnitude);
```

To read a `SetByCaller` value in C++, use the version of the function that you need (`GameplayTag` or `FName`):

```c++
float GetSetByCallerMagnitude(FName DataName, bool WarnIfNotFound = true, float DefaultIfNotFound = 0.f) const;
```
```c++
float GetSetByCallerMagnitude(FGameplayTag DataTag, bool WarnIfNotFound = true, float DefaultIfNotFound = 0.f) const;
```

I recommend using the `GameplayTag` version over the `FName` version. This can prevent spelling errors in Blueprint.

#### 4.5.10 Gameplay Effect Context
The [`GameplayEffectContext`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/FGameplayEffectContext/index.html) structure holds information about a `GameplayEffectSpec's` instigator and [`TargetData`](#concepts-targeting-data). This is also a good structure to subclass to pass arbitrary data around between places like [`ModifierMagnitudeCalculations`](#concepts-ge-mmc) / [`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculations`](#concepts-ge-ec), [`AttributeSets`](#concepts-as), and [`GameplayCues`](#concepts-gc).

To subclass the `GameplayEffectContext`:

1. Subclass `FGameplayEffectContext`
1. Override `FGameplayEffectContext::GetScriptStruct()`
1. Override `FGameplayEffectContext::Duplicate()`
1. Override `FGameplayEffectContext::NetSerialize()` if your new data needs to be replicated
1. Implement `TStructOpsTypeTraits` for your subclass, like the parent struct `FGameplayEffectContext` has
1. Override `AllocGameplayEffectContext()` in your [`AbilitySystemGlobals`](#concepts-asg) class to return a new object of your subclass

[GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) uses a subclassed `GameplayEffectContext` to add `TargetData` which can be accessed in `GameplayCues`, specifically for the shotgun since it can hit more than one enemy.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ge-mmc"></a>
#### 4.5.11 Modifier Magnitude Calculation
[`ModifierMagnitudeCalculations`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/UGameplayModMagnitudeCalculation/index.html) (`ModMagCalc` or `MMC`) are powerful classes used as [`Modifiers`](#concepts-ge-mods) in `GameplayEffects`. They function similarly to [`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculations`](#concepts-ge-ec) but are less powerful and most importantly they can be [predicted](#concepts-p). Their sole purpose is to return a float value from `CalculateBaseMagnitude_Implementation()`. You can subclass and override this function in Blueprint and C++.

`MMCs` can be used in any duration of `GameplayEffects` - `Instant`, `Duration`, `Infinite`, or `Periodic`.

`MMCs'` strength lies in their capability to capture the value of any number of `Attributes` on the `Source` or the `Target` of `GameplayEffect` with full access to the `GameplayEffectSpec` to read `GameplayTags` and `SetByCallers`. `Attributes` can either be snapshotted or not. Snapshotted `Attributes` are captured when the `GameplayEffectSpec` is created whereas non snapshotted `Attributes` are captured when the `GameplayEffectSpec` is applied and automatically update when the `Attribute` changes for `Infinite` and `Duration` `GameplayEffects`. Capturing `Attributes` recalculates their `CurrentValue` from existing mods on the `ASC`. This recalculation will **not** run [`PreAttributeChange()`](#concepts-as-preattributechange) in the `AbilitySet` so any clamping must be done here again.

| Snapshot | Source or Target | Captured on `GameplayEffectSpec` | Automatically updates when `Attribute` changes for `Infinite` or `Duration` `GE` |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yes      | Source           | Creation                         | No                                                                               |
| Yes      | Target           | Application                      | No                                                                               |
| No       | Source           | Application                      | Yes                                                                              |
| No       | Target           | Application                      | Yes                                                                              |

The resultant float from an `MMC` can further be modified in the `GameplayEffect's` `Modifier` by a coefficient and a pre and post coefficient addition.

An example `MMC` that captures the `Target's` mana `Attribute` reduces it from a poison effect where the amount reduced changes depending on how much mana the `Target` has and a tag that the `Target` might have:
```c++
UPAMMC_PoisonMana::UPAMMC_PoisonMana()
{

	//ManaDef defined in header FGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureDefinition ManaDef;
	ManaDef.AttributeToCapture = UPAAttributeSetBase::GetManaAttribute();
	ManaDef.AttributeSource = EGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureSource::Target;
	ManaDef.bSnapshot = false;

	//MaxManaDef defined in header FGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureDefinition MaxManaDef;
	MaxManaDef.AttributeToCapture = UPAAttributeSetBase::GetMaxManaAttribute();
	MaxManaDef.AttributeSource = EGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureSource::Target;
	MaxManaDef.bSnapshot = false;

	RelevantAttributesToCapture.Add(ManaDef);
	RelevantAttributesToCapture.Add(MaxManaDef);
}

float UPAMMC_PoisonMana::CalculateBaseMagnitude_Implementation(const FGameplayEffectSpec & Spec) const
{
	// Gather the tags from the source and target as that can affect which buffs should be used
	const FGameplayTagContainer* SourceTags = Spec.CapturedSourceTags.GetAggregatedTags();
	const FGameplayTagContainer* TargetTags = Spec.CapturedTargetTags.GetAggregatedTags();

	FAggregatorEvaluateParameters EvaluationParameters;
	EvaluationParameters.SourceTags = SourceTags;
	EvaluationParameters.TargetTags = TargetTags;

	float Mana = 0.f;
	GetCapturedAttributeMagnitude(ManaDef, Spec, EvaluationParameters, Mana);
	Mana = FMath::Max<float>(Mana, 0.0f);

	float MaxMana = 0.f;
	GetCapturedAttributeMagnitude(MaxManaDef, Spec, EvaluationParameters, MaxMana);
	MaxMana = FMath::Max<float>(MaxMana, 1.0f); // Avoid divide by zero

	float Reduction = -20.0f;
	if (Mana / MaxMana > 0.5f)
	{
		// Double the effect if the target has more than half their mana
		Reduction *= 2;
	}
	
	if (TargetTags->HasTagExact(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag(FName("Status.WeakToPoisonMana"))))
	{
		// Double the effect if the target is weak to PoisonMana
		Reduction *= 2;
	}
	
	return Reduction;
}
```

If you don't add the `FGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureDefinition` to `RelevantAttributesToCapture` in the `MMC's` constructor and try to capture `Attributes`, you will get an error about a missing Spec while capturing. If you don't need to capture `Attributes`, then you don't have to add anything to `RelevantAttributesToCapture`.

#### 4.5.12 Gameplay Effect Execution Calculation
[`GameplayEffectExecutionCalculations`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/UGameplayEffectExecutionCalculat-/index.html) (`ExecutionCalculation`, `Execution` (you will often see this term in the plugin's source code), or `ExecCalc`) are the most powerful way for `GameplayEffects` to make changes to an `ASC`. Like [`ModifierMagnitudeCalculations`](#concepts-ge-mmc), these can capture `Attributes` and optionally snapshot them. Unlike `MMCs`, these can change more than one `Attribute` and essentially do anything else that the programmer wants. The downside to this power and flexibility is that they can not be [predicted](#concepts-p) and they must be implemented in C++.

`ExecutionCalculations` can only be used with `Instant` and `Periodic` `GameplayEffects`. Anything with the word 'Execute' in it typically refers to these two types of `GameplayEffects`.

Snapshotting captures the `Attribute` when the `GameplayEffectSpec` is created whereas not snapshotting captures the `Attribute` when the `GameplayEffectSpec` is applied. Capturing `Attributes` recalculates their `CurrentValue` from existing mods on the `ASC`. This recalculation will **not** run [`PreAttributeChange()`](#concepts-as-preattributechange) in the `AbilitySet` so any clamping must be done here again.

| Snapshot | Source or Target | Captured on `GameplayEffectSpec` |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Yes      | Source           | Creation                         |
| Yes      | Target           | Application                      |
| No       | Source           | Application                      |
| No       | Target           | Application                      |

To set up `Attribute` capture, we follow a pattern set by Epic's ActionRPG Sample Project by defining a struct holding and defining how we capture the `Attributes` and creating one copy of it in the struct's constructor. You will have a struct like this for every `ExecCalc`. **Note:** Each struct needs a unique name as they share the same namespace. Using the same name for the structs will cause incorrect behavior in capturing your `Attributes` (mostly capturing the values of the wrong `Attributes`).

For `Local Predicted`, `Server Only`, and `Server Initiated` [`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga), the `ExecCalc` only calls on the Server.

Calculating damage received based on a complex formula reading from many attributes on the `Source` and the `Target` is the most common example of an `ExecCalc`. The included Sample Project has a simple `ExecCalc` for calculating damage that reads the value of damage from the `GameplayEffectSpec's` [`SetByCaller`](#concepts-ge-spec-setbycaller) and then mitigates that value based on the armor `Attribute` captured from the `Target`. See `GDDamageExecCalculation.cpp/.h`.

<a name="concepts-ge-ec-senddata"></a>
##### 4.5.12.1 Sending Data to Execution Calculations
There are a few ways to send data to an `ExecutionCalculation` in addition to capturing `Attributes`.

<a name="concepts-ge-ec-senddata-setbycaller"></a>
###### 4.5.12.1.1 SetByCaller
Any [`SetByCallers` set on the `GameplayEffectSpec`](#concepts-ge-spec-setbycaller) can be directly read in the `ExecutionCalculation`.

```c++
const FGameplayEffectSpec& Spec = ExecutionParams.GetOwningSpec();
float Damage = FMath::Max<float>(Spec.GetSetByCallerMagnitude(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag(FName("Data.Damage")), false, -1.0f), 0.0f);
```

<a name="concepts-ge-ec-senddata-backingdataattribute"></a>
###### 4.5.12.1.2 Backing Data Attribute Calculation Modifier
If you want to hardcode values to a `GameplayEffect`, you can pass them in using a `CalculationModifier` that uses one of the captured `Attributes` as the backing data.

In this screenshot example, we're adding 50 to the captured Damage `Attribute`. You could also set this to `Override` to just take in only the hardcoded value.

![Backing Data Attribute Calculation Modifier](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/calculationmodifierbackingdataattribute.png)

The `ExecutionCalculation` reads this value in when it captures the `Attribute`.

```c++
float Damage = 0.0f;
// Capture optional damage value set on the damage GE as a CalculationModifier under the ExecutionCalculation
ExecutionParams.AttemptCalculateCapturedAttributeMagnitude(DamageStatics().DamageDef, EvaluationParameters, Damage);
```

<a name="concepts-ge-ec-senddata-backingdatatempvariable"></a>
###### 4.5.12.1.3 Backing Data Temporary Variable Calculation Modifier
If you want to hardcode values to a `GameplayEffect`, you can pass them in using a `CalculationModifier` that uses a `Temporary Variable` or `Transient Aggregator` as it's called in C++. The `Temporary Variable` is associated with a `GameplayTag`.

In this screenshot example, we're adding 50 to a `Temporary Variable` using the `Data.Damage` `GameplayTag`.

![Backing Data Temporary Variable Calculation Modifier](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/calculationmodifierbackingdatatempvariable.png)

Add backing `Temporary Variables` to your `ExecutionCalculation`'s constructor:

```c++
ValidTransientAggregatorIdentifiers.AddTag(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag("Data.Damage"));
```

The `ExecutionCalculation` reads this value in using special capture functions similar to the `Attribute` capture functions.

```c++
float Damage = 0.0f;
ExecutionParams.AttemptCalculateTransientAggregatorMagnitude(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag("Data.Damage"), EvaluationParameters, Damage);
```

<a name="concepts-ge-ec-senddata-effectcontext"></a>
###### 4.5.12.1.4 Gameplay Effect Context
You can send data to the `ExecutionCalculation` via a custom [`GameplayEffectContext` on the `GameplayEffectSpec`](#concepts-ge-context).

In the `ExecutionCalculation` you can access the `EffectContext` from the `FGameplayEffectCustomExecutionParameters`.

```c++
const FGameplayEffectSpec& Spec = ExecutionParams.GetOwningSpec();
FGSGameplayEffectContext* ContextHandle = static_cast<FGSGameplayEffectContext*>(Spec.GetContext().Get());
```

If you need change something on the `GameplayEffectSpec` or the `EffectContext`:

```c++
FGameplayEffectSpec* MutableSpec = ExecutionParams.GetOwningSpecForPreExecuteMod();
FGSGameplayEffectContext* ContextHandle = static_cast<FGSGameplayEffectContext*>(MutableSpec->GetContext().Get());
```

Use caution if modifying the `GameplayEffectSpec` in the `ExecutionCalculation`. See the comment for `GetOwningSpecForPreExecuteMod()`.

```c++
/** Non const access. Be careful with this, especially when modifying a spec after attribute capture. */
FGameplayEffectSpec* GetOwningSpecForPreExecuteMod() const;
```

#### 4.5.13 Custom Application Requirement
[`CustomApplicationRequirement`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/UGameplayEffectCustomApplication-/index.html) (`CAR`) classes give the designers advanced control over whether a `GameplayEffect` can be applied versus the simple `GameplayTag` checks on the `GameplayEffect`. These can be implemented in Blueprint by overriding `CanApplyGameplayEffect()` and in C++ by overriding `CanApplyGameplayEffect_Implementation()`.

Examples of when to use `CARs`:
* `Target` needs to have a certain amount of an `Attribute`
* `Target` needs to have a certain number of stacks of a `GameplayEffect`

`CARs` can also do more advanced things like checking if an instance of this `GameplayEffect` is already on the `Target` and [changing the duration](#concepts-ge-duration) of the existing instance instead of applying a new instance (return false for `CanApplyGameplayEffect()`).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ge-cost"></a>
#### 4.5.14 Cost Gameplay Effect
[`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) have an optional `GameplayEffect` specifically designed to use as the cost of the ability. Costs are how much of an `Attribute` an `ASC` needs to have to be able to activate the `GameplayAbility`. If a `GA` cannot afford the `Cost GE`, then they will not be able to activate. This `Cost GE` should be an `Instant` `GameplayEffect` with one or more `Modifiers` that subtract from `Attributes`. By default, `Cost GEs` are meant to be predicted and it is recommended to maintain that capability meaning do not use `ExecutionCalculations`. `MMCs` are perfectly acceptable and encouraged for complex cost calculations.

When starting out, you will most likely have one unique `Cost GE` per `GA` that has a cost. A more advanced technique is to reuse one `Cost GE` for multiple `GAs` and just modify the `GameplayEffectSpec` created from the `Cost GE` with the `GA`-specific data (the cost value is defined on the `GA`). **This only works for `Instanced` abilities.**

Two techniques for reusing the `Cost GE`:

1. **Use an `MMC`.** This is the easiest method. Create an [`MMC`](#concepts-ge-mmc) that reads the cost value from the `GameplayAbility` instance which you can get from the `GameplayEffectSpec`.

```c++
float UPGMMC_HeroAbilityCost::CalculateBaseMagnitude_Implementation(const FGameplayEffectSpec & Spec) const
{
	const UPGGameplayAbility* Ability = Cast<UPGGameplayAbility>(Spec.GetContext().GetAbilityInstance_NotReplicated());

	if (!Ability)
	{
		return 0.0f;
	}

	return Ability->Cost.GetValueAtLevel(Ability->GetAbilityLevel());
}
```

In this example the cost value is an `FScalableFloat` on the `GameplayAbility` child class that I added to it.
```c++
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cost")
FScalableFloat Cost;
```

![Cost GE With MMC](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/costmmc.png)

2. **Override `UGameplayAbility::GetCostGameplayEffect()`.** Override this function and [create a `GameplayEffect` at runtime](#concepts-ge-dynamic) that reads the cost value on the `GameplayAbility`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ge-cooldown"></a>
#### 4.5.15 Cooldown Gameplay Effect
[`GameplayAbilities`](#concepts-ga) have an optional `GameplayEffect` specifically designed to use as the cooldown of the ability. Cooldowns determine how long after activation the ability can be activated again. If a `GA` is still on cooldown, it cannot activate. This `Cooldown GE` should be a `Duration` `GameplayEffect` with no `Modifiers` and a unique `GameplayTag` per `GameplayAbility` or per ability slot (if your game has interchangeable abilities assigned to slots that share a cooldown) in the `GameplayEffect's` `GrantedTags` ("`Cooldown Tag`"). The `GA` actually checks for the presence of the `Cooldown Tag` instead of the presence of the `Cooldown GE`. By default, `Cooldown GEs` are meant to be predicted and it is recommended to maintain that capability meaning do not use `ExecutionCalculations`. `MMCs` are perfectly acceptable and encouraged for complex cooldown calculations.

When starting out, you will most likely have one unique `Cooldown GE` per `GA` that has a cooldown. A more advanced technique is to reuse one `Cooldown GE` for multiple `GAs` and just modify the `GameplayEffectSpec` created from the `Cooldown GE` with the `GA`-specific data (the cooldown duration and the `Cooldown Tag` are defined on the `GA`). **This only works for `Instanced` abilities.**

Two techniques for reusing the `Cooldown GE`:

1. **Use a [`SetByCaller`](#concepts-ge-spec-setbycaller).** This is the easiest method. Set the duration of your shared `Cooldown GE` to `SetByCaller` with a `GameplayTag`. On your `GameplayAbility` subclass, define a float / `FScalableFloat` for the duration, a `FGameplayTagContainer` for the unique `Cooldown Tag`, and a temporary `FGameplayTagContainer` that we will use as the return pointer of the union of our `Cooldown Tag` and the `Cooldown GE's` tags.
```c++
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cooldown")
FScalableFloat CooldownDuration;

UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cooldown")
FGameplayTagContainer CooldownTags;

// Temp container that we will return the pointer to in GetCooldownTags().
// This will be a union of our CooldownTags and the Cooldown GE's cooldown tags.
UPROPERTY(Transient)
FGameplayTagContainer TempCooldownTags;
```

Then override `UGameplayAbility::GetCooldownTags()` to return the union of our `Cooldown Tags` and any existing `Cooldown GE's` tags.
```c++
const FGameplayTagContainer * UPGGameplayAbility::GetCooldownTags() const
{
	FGameplayTagContainer* MutableTags = const_cast<FGameplayTagContainer*>(&TempCooldownTags);
	MutableTags->Reset(); // MutableTags writes to the TempCooldownTags on the CDO so clear it in case the ability cooldown tags change (moved to a different slot)
	const FGameplayTagContainer* ParentTags = Super::GetCooldownTags();
	if (ParentTags)
	{
		MutableTags->AppendTags(*ParentTags);
	}
	MutableTags->AppendTags(CooldownTags);
	return MutableTags;
}
```

Finally, override `UGameplayAbility::ApplyCooldown()` to inject our `Cooldown Tags` and to add the `SetByCaller` to the cooldown `GameplayEffectSpec`.
```c++
void UPGGameplayAbility::ApplyCooldown(const FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle Handle, const FGameplayAbilityActorInfo * ActorInfo, const FGameplayAbilityActivationInfo ActivationInfo) const
{
	UGameplayEffect* CooldownGE = GetCooldownGameplayEffect();
	if (CooldownGE)
	{
		FGameplayEffectSpecHandle SpecHandle = MakeOutgoingGameplayEffectSpec(CooldownGE->GetClass(), GetAbilityLevel());
		SpecHandle.Data.Get()->DynamicGrantedTags.AppendTags(CooldownTags);
		SpecHandle.Data.Get()->SetSetByCallerMagnitude(FGameplayTag::RequestGameplayTag(FName(  OurSetByCallerTag  )), CooldownDuration.GetValueAtLevel(GetAbilityLevel()));
		ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToOwner(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, SpecHandle);
	}
}
```

In this picture, the cooldown's duration `Modifier` is set to `SetByCaller` with a `Data Tag` of `Data.Cooldown`. `Data.Cooldown` would be `OurSetByCallerTag` in the code above.

![Cooldown GE with SetByCaller](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/cooldownsbc.png)

2. **Use an [`MMC`](#concepts-ge-mmc).** This has the same setup as above except for setting the `SetByCaller` as the duration on the `Cooldown GE` and in `ApplyCooldown`. Instead, set the duration to be a `Custom Calculation Class` and point to the new `MMC` that we will make.
```c++
UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cooldown")
FScalableFloat CooldownDuration;

UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditAnywhere, Category = "Cooldown")
FGameplayTagContainer CooldownTags;

// Temp container that we will return the pointer to in GetCooldownTags().
// This will be a union of our CooldownTags and the Cooldown GE's cooldown tags.
UPROPERTY(Transient)
FGameplayTagContainer TempCooldownTags;
```

Then override `UGameplayAbility::GetCooldownTags()` to return the union of our `Cooldown Tags` and any existing `Cooldown GE's` tags.
```c++
const FGameplayTagContainer * UPGGameplayAbility::GetCooldownTags() const
{
	FGameplayTagContainer* MutableTags = const_cast<FGameplayTagContainer*>(&TempCooldownTags);
	MutableTags->Reset(); // MutableTags writes to the TempCooldownTags on the CDO so clear it in case the ability cooldown tags change (moved to a different slot)
	const FGameplayTagContainer* ParentTags = Super::GetCooldownTags();
	if (ParentTags)
	{
		MutableTags->AppendTags(*ParentTags);
	}
	MutableTags->AppendTags(CooldownTags);
	return MutableTags;
}
```

Finally, override `UGameplayAbility::ApplyCooldown()` to inject our `Cooldown Tags` into the cooldown `GameplayEffectSpec`.
```c++
void UPGGameplayAbility::ApplyCooldown(const FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle Handle, const FGameplayAbilityActorInfo * ActorInfo, const FGameplayAbilityActivationInfo ActivationInfo) const
{
	UGameplayEffect* CooldownGE = GetCooldownGameplayEffect();
	if (CooldownGE)
	{
		FGameplayEffectSpecHandle SpecHandle = MakeOutgoingGameplayEffectSpec(CooldownGE->GetClass(), GetAbilityLevel());
		SpecHandle.Data.Get()->DynamicGrantedTags.AppendTags(CooldownTags);
		ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToOwner(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, SpecHandle);
	}
}
```

```c++
float UPGMMC_HeroAbilityCooldown::CalculateBaseMagnitude_Implementation(const FGameplayEffectSpec & Spec) const
{
	const UPGGameplayAbility* Ability = Cast<UPGGameplayAbility>(Spec.GetContext().GetAbilityInstance_NotReplicated());

	if (!Ability)
	{
		return 0.0f;
	}

	return Ability->CooldownDuration.GetValueAtLevel(Ability->GetAbilityLevel());
}

		TArray< TPair<float, float> > DurationAndTimeRemaining = AbilitySystemComponent->GetActiveEffectsTimeRemainingAndDuration(Query);
		if (DurationAndTimeRemaining.Num() > 0)
		{
			int32 BestIdx = 0;
			float LongestTime = DurationAndTimeRemaining[0].Key;
			for (int32 Idx = 1; Idx < DurationAndTimeRemaining.Num(); ++Idx)
			{
				if (DurationAndTimeRemaining[Idx].Key > LongestTime)
				{
					LongestTime = DurationAndTimeRemaining[Idx].Key;
					BestIdx = Idx;
				}
			}

			TimeRemaining = DurationAndTimeRemaining[BestIdx].Key;
			CooldownDuration = DurationAndTimeRemaining[BestIdx].Value;

			return true;
		}
	}

	return false;
}
```

**Note:** Querying the cooldown's time remaining on clients requires that they can receive replicated `GameplayEffects`. This will depend on their `ASC's` [replication mode](#concepts-asc-rm).

<a name="concepts-ge-cooldown-listen"></a>
##### 4.5.15.2 Listening for Cooldown Begin and End
To listen for when a cooldown begins, you can either respond to when the `Cooldown GE` is applied by binding to `AbilitySystemComponent->OnActiveGameplayEffectAddedDelegateToSelf` or when the `Cooldown Tag` is added by binding to `AbilitySystemComponent->RegisterGameplayTagEvent(CooldownTag, EGameplayTagEventType::NewOrRemoved)`. I recommend listening for when the `Cooldown GE` is added because you also have access to the `GameplayEffectSpec` that applied it. From this you can determine if the `Cooldown GE` is the locally predicted one or the Server's correcting one.

To listen for when a cooldown ends, you can either respond to when the `Cooldown GE` is removed by binding to `AbilitySystemComponent->OnAnyGameplayEffectRemovedDelegate()` or when the `Cooldown Tag` is removed by binding to `AbilitySystemComponent->RegisterGameplayTagEvent(CooldownTag, EGameplayTagEventType::NewOrRemoved)`. I recommend listening for when the `Cooldown Tag` is removed because when the Server's corrected `Cooldown GE` comes in, it will remove our locally predicted one causing the `OnAnyGameplayEffectRemovedDelegate()` to fire even though we're still on cooldown. The `Cooldown Tag` will not change during the removal of the predicted `Cooldown GE` and the application of the Server's corrected `Cooldown GE`.

**Note:** Listening for a `GameplayEffect` to be added or removed on clients requires that they can receive replicated `GameplayEffects`. This will depend on their `ASC's` [replication mode](#concepts-asc-rm).

The Sample Project includes a custom Blueprint node that listens for cooldowns beginning and ending. The HUD UMG Widget uses it to update the amount of time remaining on the Meteor's cooldown. This `AsyncTask` will live forever until manually called `EndTask()`, which we do in the UMG Widget's `Destruct` event. See [`AsyncTaskCooldownChanged.h/cpp`](Source/GASDocumentation/Private/Characters/Abilities/AsyncTaskCooldownChanged.cpp).

![Listen for Cooldown Change BP Node](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/cooldownchange.png)

<a name="concepts-ge-cooldown-prediction"></a>
##### 4.5.15.3 Predicting Cooldowns
Cooldowns cannot really be predicted currently. We can start UI cooldown timer's when the locally predicted `Cooldown GE` is applied but the `GameplayAbility's` actual cooldown is tied to the server's cooldown's time remaining. Depending on the player's latency, the locally predicted cooldown could expire but the `GameplayAbility` would still be on cooldown on the server and this would prevent the `GameplayAbility's` immediate re-activation until the server's cooldown expires.

The Sample Project handles this by graying out the Meteor ability's UI icon when the locally predicted cooldown begins and then starting the cooldown timer once the server's corrected `Cooldown GE` comes in.

A gameplay consequence of this is that players with high latencies have a lower rate of fire on short cooldown abilities than players with lower latencies putting them at a disadvantage. Fortnite avoids this by their weapons having custom bookkeeping that do not use cooldown `GameplayEffects`.

Allowing for true predicted cooldowns (player could activate a `GameplayAbility` when the local cooldown expires but the server is still on cooldown) is something that Epic would like to implement someday in a [future iteration of GAS](#concepts-p-future).

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ge-duration"></a>
#### 4.5.16 Changing Active Gameplay Effect Duration
To change the time remaining for a `Cooldown GE` or any `Duration` `GameplayEffect`, we need to change the `GameplayEffectSpec's` `Duration`, update its `StartServerWorldTime`, update its `CachedStartServerWorldTime`, update its `StartWorldTime`, and rerun the check on the duration with `CheckDuration()`. Doing this on the server and marking the `FActiveGameplayEffect` dirty will replicate the changes to clients.
**Note:** This does involve a `const_cast` and may not be Epic's intended way of changing durations, but it seems to work well so far.

```c++
bool UPAAbilitySystemComponent::SetGameplayEffectDurationHandle(FActiveGameplayEffectHandle Handle, float NewDuration)
{
	if (!Handle.IsValid())
	{
		return false;
	}

	const FActiveGameplayEffect* ActiveGameplayEffect = GetActiveGameplayEffect(Handle);
	if (!ActiveGameplayEffect)
	{
		return false;
	}

	FActiveGameplayEffect* AGE = const_cast<FActiveGameplayEffect*>(ActiveGameplayEffect);
	if (NewDuration > 0)
	{
		AGE->Spec.Duration = NewDuration;
	}
	else
	{
		AGE->Spec.Duration = 0.01f;
	}

	AGE->StartServerWorldTime = ActiveGameplayEffects.GetServerWorldTime();
	AGE->CachedStartServerWorldTime = AGE->StartServerWorldTime;
	AGE->StartWorldTime = ActiveGameplayEffects.GetWorldTime();
	ActiveGameplayEffects.MarkItemDirty(*AGE);
	ActiveGameplayEffects.CheckDuration(Handle);

	AGE->EventSet.OnTimeChanged.Broadcast(AGE->Handle, AGE->StartWorldTime, AGE->GetDuration());
	OnGameplayEffectDurationChange(*AGE);

	return true;
}
```

<a name="concepts-ge-dynamic"></a>
#### 4.5.17 Creating Dynamic Gameplay Effects at Runtime
Creating Dynamic `GameplayEffects` at runtime is an advanced topic. You shouldn't have to do this too often.

Only `Instant` `GameplayEffects` can be created at runtime from scratch in C++. `Duration` and `Infinite` `GameplayEffects` cannot be created dynamically at runtime because when they replicate they look for the `GameplayEffect` class definition that does not exist. To achieve this functionality, you should instead make an archetype `GameplayEffect` class like you would normally do in the Editor. Then customize the `GameplayEffectSpec` instance with what you need at runtime.

`Instant` `GameplayEffects` created at runtime can also be called from within a [local predicted](#concepts-p) `GameplayAbility`. However, it is unknown yet if the dynamic creation can have side effects.

##### Examples

The Sample Project creates one to send the gold and experience points back to the killer of a character when it takes the killing blow in its `AttributeSet`.

```c++
// Create a dynamic instant Gameplay Effect to give the bounties
UGameplayEffect* GEBounty = NewObject<UGameplayEffect>(GetTransientPackage(), FName(TEXT("Bounty")));
GEBounty->DurationPolicy = EGameplayEffectDurationType::Instant;

int32 Idx = GEBounty->Modifiers.Num();
GEBounty->Modifiers.SetNum(Idx + 2);

FGameplayModifierInfo& InfoXP = GEBounty->Modifiers[Idx];
InfoXP.ModifierMagnitude = FScalableFloat(GetXPBounty());
InfoXP.ModifierOp = EGameplayModOp::Additive;
InfoXP.Attribute = UGDAttributeSetBase::GetXPAttribute();

FGameplayModifierInfo& InfoGold = GEBounty->Modifiers[Idx + 1];
InfoGold.ModifierMagnitude = FScalableFloat(GetGoldBounty());
InfoGold.ModifierOp = EGameplayModOp::Additive;
InfoGold.Attribute = UGDAttributeSetBase::GetGoldAttribute();

Source->ApplyGameplayEffectToSelf(GEBounty, 1.0f, Source->MakeEffectContext());
```

A second example shows a runtime `GameplayEffect` created within a local predicted `GameplayAbility`. Use at your own risk (see comments in code)!

```c++
UGameplayAbilityRuntimeGE::UGameplayAbilityRuntimeGE()
{
	NetExecutionPolicy = EGameplayAbilityNetExecutionPolicy::LocalPredicted;
}

void UGameplayAbilityRuntimeGE::ActivateAbility(const FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle Handle, const FGameplayAbilityActorInfo* ActorInfo, const FGameplayAbilityActivationInfo ActivationInfo, const FGameplayEventData* TriggerEventData)
{
	if (HasAuthorityOrPredictionKey(ActorInfo, &ActivationInfo))
	{
		if (!CommitAbility(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo))
		{
			EndAbility(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, true, true);
		}

		// Create the GE at runtime.
		UGameplayEffect* GameplayEffect = NewObject<UGameplayEffect>(GetTransientPackage(), TEXT("RuntimeInstantGE"));
		GameplayEffect->DurationPolicy = EGameplayEffectDurationType::Instant; // Only instant works with runtime GE.

		// Add a simple scalable float modifier, which overrides MyAttribute with 42.
		// In real world applications, consume information passed via TriggerEventData.
		const int32 Idx = GameplayEffect->Modifiers.Num();
		GameplayEffect->Modifiers.SetNum(Idx + 1);
		FGameplayModifierInfo& ModifierInfo = GameplayEffect->Modifiers[Idx];
		ModifierInfo.Attribute.SetUProperty(UMyAttributeSet::GetMyModifiedAttribute());
		ModifierInfo.ModifierMagnitude = FScalableFloat(42.f);
		ModifierInfo.ModifierOp = EGameplayModOp::Override;

		// Apply the GE.

		// Create the GESpec here to avoid the behavior of ASC to create GESpecs from the GE class default object.
		// Since we have a dynamic GE here, this would create a GESpec with the base GameplayEffect class, so we
		// would lose our modifiers. Attention: It is unknown, if this "hack" done here can have drawbacks!
		// The spec prevents the GE object being collected by the GarbageCollector, since the GE is a UPROPERTY on the spec.
		FGameplayEffectSpec* GESpec = new FGameplayEffectSpec(GameplayEffect, {}, 0.f); // "new", since lifetime is managed by a shared ptr within the handle
		ApplyGameplayEffectSpecToOwner(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, FGameplayEffectSpecHandle(GESpec));
	}
	EndAbility(Handle, ActorInfo, ActivationInfo, false, false);
}
```

<a name="concepts-ge-containers"></a>
#### 4.5.18 Gameplay Effect Containers
Epic's [Action RPG Sample Project](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/action-rpg) implements a structure called `FGameplayEffectContainer`. These are not in vanilla GAS but are extremely handy for containing `GameplayEffects` and [`TargetData`](#concepts-targeting-data). It automates some of the effort like creating `GameplayEffectSpecs` from `GameplayEffects` and setting default values in its `GameplayEffectContext`. Making a `GameplayEffectContainer` in a `GameplayAbility` and passing it to spawned projectiles is very easy and straightforward. I opted not to implement the `GameplayEffectContainers` in the included Sample Project to show how you would work without them in vanilla GAS, but I highly recommend looking into them and considering adding them to your project.

To access the `GESpecs` inside of the `GameplayEffectContainers` to do things like adding `SetByCallers`, break the `FGameplayEffectContainer` and access the `GESpec` reference by its index in the array of `GESpecs`. This requires that you know the index ahead of time of the `GESpec` that you want to access.

![SetByCaller with a GameplayEffectContainer](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/gecontainersetbycaller.png)

`GameplayEffectContainers` also contain an optional efficient means of [targeting](#concepts-targeting-containers).

### 4.6 Gameplay Abilities

<a name="concepts-ga-definition"></a>
#### 4.6.1 Gameplay Ability Definition
[`GameplayAbilities`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/API/Plugins/GameplayAbilities/Abilities/UGameplayAbility/index.html) (`GA`) are any actions or skills that an `Actor` can do in the game. More than one `GameplayAbility` can be active at one time for example sprinting and shooting a gun. These can be made in Blueprint or C++.

Examples of `GameplayAbilities`:
* Jumping
* Sprinting
* Shooting a gun
* Passively blocking an attack every X number of seconds
* Using a potion
* Opening a door
* Collecting a resource
* Constructing a building

Things that should not be implemented with `GameplayAbilities`:
* Basic movement input
* Some interactions with UIs - Don't use a `GameplayAbility` to purchase an item from a store.

These are not rules, just my recommendations. Your design and implementations may vary.

`GameplayAbilities` come with default functionality to have a level to modify the amount of change to attributes or to change the `GameplayAbility's` functionality.

`GameplayAbilities` run on the owning client and/or the server depending on the [`Net Execution Policy`](#concepts-ga-net) but not simulated proxies. The `Net Execution Policy` determines if a `GameplayAbility` will be locally [predicted](#concepts-p). They include default behavior for [optional cost and cooldown `GameplayEffects`](#concepts-ga-commit). `GameplayAbilities` use [`AbilityTasks`](#concepts-at) for actions that happen over time like waiting for an event, waiting for an attribute change, waiting for players to choose a target, or moving a `Character` with `Root Motion Source`. **Simulated clients will not run `GameplayAbilities`**. Instead, when the server runs the ability, anything that visually needs to play on the simulated proxies (like animation montages) will be replicated or RPC'd through `AbilityTasks` or [`GameplayCues`](#concepts-gc) for cosmetic things like sounds and particles.

All `GameplayAbilities` will have their `ActivateAbility()` function overriden with your gameplay logic. Additional logic can be added to `EndAbility()` that runs when the `GameplayAbility` completes or is canceled.

Flowchart of a simple `GameplayAbility`:
![Simple GameplayAbility Flowchart](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/abilityflowchartsimple.png)


Flowchart of a more complex `GameplayAbility`:
![Complex GameplayAbility Flowchart](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/raw/master/Images/abilityflowchartcomplex.png)

Complex abilities can be implemented using multiple `GameplayAbilities` that interact (activate, cancel, etc) with each other.

<a name="concepts-ga-definition-reppolicy"></a>
##### 4.6.1.1 Replication Policy
Don't use this option. The name is misleading and you don't need it. [`GameplayAbilitySpecs`](#concepts-ga-spec) are replicated from the server to the owning client by default. As mentioned above, **`GameplayAbilities` don't run on simulated proxies**. They use `AbilityTasks` and `GameplayCues` to replicate or RPC visual changes to the simulated proxies. Dave Ratti from Epic has stated his desire to [remove this option in the future](https://epicgames.ent.box.com/s/m1egifkxv3he3u3xezb9hzbgroxyhx89).

<a name="concepts-ga-definition-remotecancel"></a>
##### 4.6.1.2 Server Respects Remote Ability Cancellation
This option causes trouble more often than not. It means if the client's `GameplayAbility` ends either due to cancellation or natural completion, it will force the server's version to end whether it completed or not. The latter issue is the important one, especially for locally predicted `GameplayAbilities` used by players with high latencies. Generally you will want to disable this option.

<a name="concepts-ga-definition-repinputdirectly"></a>
##### 4.6.1.3 Replicate Input Directly
Setting this option will always replicate input press and release events to the server. Epic recommends not using this and instead relying on the `Generic Replicated Events` that are built into the existing input related [`AbilityTasks`](#concepts-at) if you have your [input bound to your `ASC`](#concepts-ga-input).

Epic's comment:
```c++
/** Direct Input state replication. These will be called if bReplicateInputDirectly is true on the ability and is generally not a good thing to use. (Instead, prefer to use Generic Replicated Events). */
UAbilitySystemComponent::ServerSetInputPressed()
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ga-input"></a>
#### 4.6.2 Binding Input to the ASC
The `ASC` allows you to directly bind input actions to it and assign those inputs to `GameplayAbilities` when you grant them. Input actions assigned to `GameplayAbilities` automatically activate those `GameplayAbilities` when pressed if the `GameplayTag` requirements are met. Assigned input actions are required to use the built-in `AbilityTasks` that respond to input.

In addition to input actions assigned to activate `GameplayAbilities`, the `ASC` also accepts generic `Confirm` and `Cancel` inputs. These special inputs are used by `AbilityTasks` for confirming things like [`Target Actors`](#concepts-targeting-actors) or canceling them.

To bind input to an `ASC`, you must first create an enum that translates the input action name to a byte. The enum name must match exactly to the name used for the input action in the project settings. The `DisplayName` does not matter.

From the Sample Project:
```c++
UENUM(BlueprintType)
enum class EGDAbilityInputID : uint8
{
	// 0 None
	None			UMETA(DisplayName = "None"),
	// 1 Confirm
	Confirm			UMETA(DisplayName = "Confirm"),
	// 2 Cancel
	Cancel			UMETA(DisplayName = "Cancel"),
	// 3 LMB
	Ability1		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability1"),
	// 4 RMB
	Ability2		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability2"),
	// 5 Q
	Ability3		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability3"),
	// 6 E
	Ability4		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability4"),
	// 7 R
	Ability5		UMETA(DisplayName = "Ability5"),
	// 8 Sprint
	Sprint			UMETA(DisplayName = "Sprint"),
	// 9 Jump
	Jump			UMETA(DisplayName = "Jump")
};
```

If your `ASC` lives on the `Character`, then in `SetupPlayerInputComponent()` include the function for binding to the `ASC`:
```c++
// Bind to AbilitySystemComponent
FTopLevelAssetPath AbilityEnumAssetPath = FTopLevelAssetPath(FName("/Script/GASDocumentation"), FName("EGDAbilityInputID"));
AbilitySystemComponent->BindAbilityActivationToInputComponent(PlayerInputComponent, FGameplayAbilityInputBinds(FString("ConfirmTarget"),
	FString("CancelTarget"), AbilityEnumAssetPath, static_cast<int32>(EGDAbilityInputID::Confirm), static_cast<int32>(EGDAbilityInputID::Cancel)));
```

If your `ASC` lives on the `PlayerState`, there is a potential race condition inside of `SetupPlayerInputComponent()` where the `PlayerState` may not have replicated to the client yet. Therefore, I recommend attempting to bind to input in `SetupPlayerInputComponent()` and `OnRep_PlayerState()`. `OnRep_PlayerState()` is not sufficient by itself because there could be a case where the `Actor's` `InputComponent` could be null when `PlayerState` replicates before the `PlayerController` tells the client to call `ClientRestart()` which creates the `InputComponent`. The Sample Project demonstrates attempting to bind in both locations with a boolean gating the process so it only actually binds the input once.

**Note:** In the Sample Project `Confirm` and `Cancel` in the enum don't match the input action names in the project settings (`ConfirmTarget` and `CancelTarget`), but we supply the mapping between them in `BindAbilityActivationToInputComponent()`. These are special since we supply the mapping and they don't have to match, but they can match. All other inputs in the enum must match the input action names in the project settings.

For `GameplayAbilities` that will only ever be activated by one input (they will always exist in the same "slot" like a MOBA), I prefer to add a variable to my `UGameplayAbility` subclass where I can define their input. I can then read this from the `ClassDefaultObject` when granting the ability.

<a name="concepts-ga-input-noactivate"></a>
##### 4.6.2.1 Binding to Input without Activating Abilities
If you don't want your `GameplayAbilities` to automatically activate when an input is pressed but still bind them to input to use with `AbilityTasks`, you can add a new bool variable to your `UGameplayAbility` subclass, `bActivateOnInput`, that defaults to `true` and override `UAbilitySystemComponent::AbilityLocalInputPressed()`.

```c++
void UGSAbilitySystemComponent::AbilityLocalInputPressed(int32 InputID)
{
	// Consume the input if this InputID is overloaded with GenericConfirm/Cancel and the GenericConfim/Cancel callback is bound
	if (IsGenericConfirmInputBound(InputID))
	{
		LocalInputConfirm();
		return;
	}

	if (IsGenericCancelInputBound(InputID))
	{
		LocalInputCancel();
		return;
	}

	// ---------------------------------------------------------

	ABILITYLIST_SCOPE_LOCK();
	for (FGameplayAbilitySpec& Spec : ActivatableAbilities.Items)
	{
		if (Spec.InputID == InputID)
		{
			if (Spec.Ability)
			{
				Spec.InputPressed = true;
				if (Spec.IsActive())
				{
					if (Spec.Ability->bReplicateInputDirectly && IsOwnerActorAuthoritative() == false)
					{
						ServerSetInputPressed(Spec.Handle);
					}

					AbilitySpecInputPressed(Spec);

					// Invoke the InputPressed event. This is not replicated here. If someone is listening, they may replicate the InputPressed event to the server.
					InvokeReplicatedEvent(EAbilityGenericReplicatedEvent::InputPressed, Spec.Handle, Spec.ActivationInfo.GetActivationPredictionKey());
				}
				else
				{
					UGSGameplayAbility* GA = Cast<UGSGameplayAbility>(Spec.Ability);
					if (GA && GA->bActivateOnInput)
					{
						// Ability is not active, so try to activate it
						TryActivateAbility(Spec.Handle);
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

<a name="concepts-ga-granting"></a>
#### 4.6.3 Granting Abilities
Granting a `GameplayAbility` to an `ASC` adds it to the `ASC's` list of `ActivatableAbilities` allowing it to activate the `GameplayAbility` at will if it meets the [`GameplayTag` requirements](#concepts-ga-tags).

We grant `GameplayAbilities` on the server which then automatically replicates the [`GameplayAbilitySpec`](#concepts-ga-spec) to the owning client. Other clients / simulated proxies do not receive the `GameplayAbilitySpec`.

The Sample Project stores a `TArray<TSubclassOf<UGDGameplayAbility>>` on the `Character` class that it reads from and grants when the game starts:
```c++
void AGDCharacterBase::AddCharacterAbilities()
{
	// Grant abilities, but only on the server	
	if (Role != ROLE_Authority || !AbilitySystemComponent.IsValid() || AbilitySystemComponent->bCharacterAbilitiesGiven)
	{
		return;
	}

	for (TSubclassOf<UGDGameplayAbility>& StartupAbility : CharacterAbilities)
	{
		AbilitySystemComponent->GiveAbility(
			FGameplayAbilitySpec(StartupAbility, GetAbilityLevel(StartupAbility.GetDefaultObject()->AbilityID), static_cast<int32>(StartupAbility.GetDefaultObject()->AbilityInputID), this));
	}

	AbilitySystemComponent->bCharacterAbilitiesGiven = true;
}
```

When granting these `GameplayAbilities`, we're creating `GameplayAbilitySpecs` with the `UGameplayAbility` class, the ability level, the input that it is bound to, and the `SourceObject` or who gave this `GameplayAbility` to this `ASC`.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ga-activating"></a>
#### 4.6.4 Activating Abilities
If a `GameplayAbility` is assigned an input action, it will be automatically activated if the input is pressed and it meets its `GameplayTag` requirements. This may not always be the desirable way to activate a `GameplayAbility`. The `ASC` provides four other methods of activating `GameplayAbilities`: by `GameplayTag`, `GameplayAbility` class, `GameplayAbilitySpec` handle, and by an event. Activating a `GameplayAbility` by event allows you to [pass in a payload of data with the event](#concepts-ga-data).

```c++
UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "Abilities")
bool TryActivateAbilitiesByTag(const FGameplayTagContainer& GameplayTagContainer, bool bAllowRemoteActivation = true);

UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "Abilities")
bool TryActivateAbilityByClass(TSubclassOf<UGameplayAbility> InAbilityToActivate, bool bAllowRemoteActivation = true);

bool TryActivateAbility(FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle AbilityToActivate, bool bAllowRemoteActivation = true);

bool TriggerAbilityFromGameplayEvent(FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle AbilityToTrigger, FGameplayAbilityActorInfo* ActorInfo, FGameplayTag Tag, const FGameplayEventData* Payload, UAbilitySystemComponent& Component);

FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle GiveAbilityAndActivateOnce(const FGameplayAbilitySpec& AbilitySpec, const FGameplayEventData* GameplayEventData);
```
To activate a `GameplayAbility` by event, the `GameplayAbility` must have its `Triggers` set up in the `GameplayAbility`. Assign a `GameplayTag` and pick an option for `GameplayEvent`. To send the event, use the function `UAbilitySystemBlueprintLibrary::SendGameplayEventToActor(AActor* Actor, FGameplayTag EventTag, FGameplayEventData Payload)`. Activating a `GameplayAbility` by event allows you to pass in a payload with data.

`GameplayAbility` `Triggers` also allow you to activate the `GameplayAbility` when a `GameplayTag` is added or removed.

**Note:** When activating a `GameplayAbility` from event in Blueprint, you must use the `ActivateAbilityFromEvent` node and the standard `ActivateAbility` node **cannot exist** in your graph. If the `ActivateAbility` node exists, it will always be called over the `ActivateAbilityFromEvent` node.

**Note:** Don't forget to call `EndAbility()` when the `GameplayAbility` should terminate unless you have a `GameplayAbility` that will always run like a passive ability.

Activation sequence for **locally predicted** `GameplayAbilities`:
1. **Owning client** calls `TryActivateAbility()`
1. Calls `InternalTryActivateAbility()`
1. Calls `CanActivateAbility()` and returns whether `GameplayTag` requirements are met, if the `ASC` can afford the cost, if the `GameplayAbility` is not on cooldown, and if no other instances are currently active
1. Calls `CallServerTryActivateAbility()` and passes it the `Prediction Key` that it generates
1. Calls `CallActivateAbility()`
1. Calls `PreActivate()` Epic refers to this as "boilerplate init stuff"
1. Calls `ActivateAbility()` finally activating the ability

**Server** receives `CallServerTryActivateAbility()`
1. Calls `ServerTryActivateAbility()`
1. Calls `InternalServerTryActivateAbility()` 
1. Calls `InternalTryActivateAbility()`
1. Calls `CanActivateAbility()` and returns whether `GameplayTag` requirements are met, if the `ASC` can afford the cost, if the `GameplayAbility` is not on cooldown, and if no other instances are currently active
1. Calls `ClientActivateAbilitySucceed()` if successful telling it to update its `ActivationInfo` that its activation was confirmed by the server and broadcasting the `OnConfirmDelegate` delegate. This is not the same as input confirmation.
1. Calls `CallActivateAbility()`
1. Calls `PreActivate()` Epic refers to this as "boilerplate init stuff"
1. Calls `ActivateAbility()` finally activating the ability

If at any time the server fails to activate, it will call `ClientActivateAbilityFailed()`, immediately terminating the client's `GameplayAbility` and undoing any predicted changes.

<a name="concepts-ga-activating-passive"></a>
##### 4.6.4.1 Passive Abilities
To implement passive `GameplayAbilities` that automatically activate and run continuously, override `UGameplayAbility::OnAvatarSet()` which is automatically called when a `GameplayAbility` is granted and the `AvatarActor` is set and call `TryActivateAbility()`.

I recommend adding a `bool` to your custom `UGameplayAbility` class specifying if the `GameplayAbility` should be activated when granted. The Sample Project does this for its passive armor stacking ability.

Passive `GameplayAbilities` will typically have a [`Net Execution Policy`](#concepts-ga-net) of `Server Only`.

```c++
void UGDGameplayAbility::OnAvatarSet(const FGameplayAbilityActorInfo * ActorInfo, const FGameplayAbilitySpec & Spec)
{
	Super::OnAvatarSet(ActorInfo, Spec);

	if (bActivateAbilityOnGranted)
	{
		ActorInfo->AbilitySystemComponent->TryActivateAbility(Spec.Handle, false);
	}
}
```

Epic describes this function as the correct place to initiate passive abilities and to do `BeginPlay` type things.

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ga-activating-failedtags"></a>
##### 4.6.4.2 Activation Failed Tags

Abilities have default logic to tell you why an ability activation failed. To enable this, you must set up the GameplayTags that correspond to the default failure cases.

Add these tags (or your own naming convention) to your project:
```
+GameplayTagList=(Tag="Activation.Fail.BlockedByTags",DevComment="")
+GameplayTagList=(Tag="Activation.Fail.CantAffordCost",DevComment="")
+GameplayTagList=(Tag="Activation.Fail.IsDead",DevComment="")
+GameplayTagList=(Tag="Activation.Fail.MissingTags",DevComment="")
+GameplayTagList=(Tag="Activation.Fail.Networking",DevComment="")
+GameplayTagList=(Tag="Activation.Fail.OnCooldown",DevComment="")
```

Then add them to the [`GASDocumentation\Config\DefaultGame.ini`](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation/blob/master/Config/DefaultGame.ini#L8-L13):
```
[/Script/GameplayAbilities.AbilitySystemGlobals]
ActivateFailIsDeadName=Activation.Fail.IsDead
ActivateFailCooldownName=Activation.Fail.OnCooldown
ActivateFailCostName=Activation.Fail.CantAffordCost
ActivateFailTagsBlockedName=Activation.Fail.BlockedByTags
ActivateFailTagsMissingName=Activation.Fail.MissingTags
ActivateFailNetworkingName=Activation.Fail.Networking
```

Now whenever an ability activation fails, this corresponding GameplayTag will be included in output log messages or visible on the `showdebug AbilitySystem` hud.
```
LogAbilitySystem: Display: InternalServerTryActivateAbility. Rejecting ClientActivation of Default__GA_FireGun_C. InternalTryActivateAbility failed: Activation.Fail.BlockedByTags
LogAbilitySystem: Display: ClientActivateAbilityFailed_Implementation. PredictionKey :109 Ability: Default__GA_FireGun_C
```

**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

<a name="concepts-ga-cancelabilities"></a>
#### 4.6.5 Canceling Abilities
To cancel a `GameplayAbility` from within, you call `CancelAbility()`. This will call `EndAbility()` and set its `WasCancelled` parameter to true.

To cancel a `GameplayAbility` externally, the `ASC` provides a few functions:

```c++
/** Cancels the specified ability CDO. */
void CancelAbility(UGameplayAbility* Ability);	

/** Cancels the ability indicated by passed in spec handle. If handle is not found among reactivated abilities nothing happens. */
void CancelAbilityHandle(const FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle& AbilityHandle);

/** Cancel all abilities with the specified tags. Will not cancel the Ignore instance */
void CancelAbilities(const FGameplayTagContainer* WithTags=nullptr, const FGameplayTagContainer* WithoutTags=nullptr, UGameplayAbility* Ignore=nullptr);

/** Cancels all abilities regardless of tags. Will not cancel the ignore instance */
void CancelAllAbilities(UGameplayAbility* Ignore=nullptr);

/** Cancels all abilities and kills any remaining instanced abilities */
virtual void DestroyActiveState();
```

**Note:** I have found that `CancelAllAbilities` doesn't seem to work right if you have a `Non-Instanced` `GameplayAbilities`. It seems to hit the `Non-Instanced` `GameplayAbility` and give up. `CancelAbilities` can handle `Non-Instanced` `GameplayAbilities` better and that is what the Sample Project uses (Jump is a non-instanced `GameplayAbility`). Your mileage may vary.

#### 4.6.6 Getting Active Abilities
Beginners often ask "How can I get the active ability?" perhaps to set variables on it or to cancel it. More than one `GameplayAbility` can be active at a time so there is no one "active ability". Instead, you must search through an `ASC's` list of `ActivatableAbilities` (granted `GameplayAbilities` that the `ASC` owns) and find the one matching the [`Asset` or `Granted` `GameplayTag`](#concepts-ga-tags) that you are looking for.

`UAbilitySystemComponent::GetActivatableAbilities()` returns a `TArray<FGameplayAbilitySpec>` for you to iterate over.

The `ASC` also has another helper function that takes in a `GameplayTagContainer` as a parameter to assist in searching instead of manually iterating over the list of `GameplayAbilitySpecs`. The `bOnlyAbilitiesThatSatisfyTagRequirements` parameter will only return `GameplayAbilitySpecs` that satisfy their `GameplayTag` requirements and could be activated right now. For example, you could have two basic attack `GameplayAbilities`, one with a weapon and one with bare fists, and the correct one activates depending on if a weapon is equipped setting the `GameplayTag` requirement. See Epic's comment on the function for more information.
```c++
UAbilitySystemComponent::GetActivatableGameplayAbilitySpecsByAllMatchingTags(const FGameplayTagContainer& GameplayTagContainer, TArray < struct FGameplayAbilitySpec* >& MatchingGameplayAbilities, bool bOnlyAbilitiesThatSatisfyTagRequirements = true)
```

Once you get the `FGameplayAbilitySpec` that you are looking for, you can call `IsActive()` on it.

#### 4.6.7 Instancing Policy
A `GameplayAbility's` `Instancing Policy` determines if and how the `GameplayAbility` is instanced when activated.

| `Instancing Policy`     | Description                                                                                      | Example of when to use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instanced Per Actor     | Each `ASC` only has one instance of the `GameplayAbility` that is reused between activations.    | This will probably be the `Instancing Policy` that you use the most. You can use it for any ability and provides persistence between activations. The designer is responsible for manually resetting any variables between activations that need it.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Instanced Per Execution | Every time a `GameplayAbility` is activated, a new instance of the `GameplayAbility` is created. | The benefit of these `GameplayAbilities` is that the variables are reset everytime you activate. These provide worse performance than `Instanced Per Actor` since they will spawn new `GameplayAbilities` every time they activate. The Sample Project does not use any of these.                                                                                                                                  |
| Non-Instanced           | The `GameplayAbility` operates on its `ClassDefaultObject`. No instances are created.            | This has the best performance of the three but is the most restrictive in what can be done with it. `Non-Instanced` `GameplayAbilities` cannot store state, meaning no dynamic variables and no binding to `AbilityTask` delegates. The best place to use them is for frequently used simple abilities like minion basic attacks in a MOBA or RTS. The Sample Project's Jump `GameplayAbility` is `Non-Instanced`. |

#### 4.6.8 Net Execution Policy
A `GameplayAbility's` `Net Execution Policy` determines who runs the `GameplayAbility` and in what order.

| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Local Only`           | The `GameplayAbility` is only run on the owning client. This could be useful for abilities that only make local cosmetic changes. Single player games should use `Server Only`.                                    |
| `Local Predicted`      | `Local Predicted` `GameplayAbilities` activate first on the owning client and then on the server. The server's version will correct anything that the client predicted incorrectly. See [Prediction](#concepts-p). |
| `Server Only`          | The `GameplayAbility` is only run on the server. Passive `GameplayAbilities` will typically be `Server Only`. Single player games should use this.                                                                 |
| `Server Initiated`     | `Server Initiated` `GameplayAbilities` activate first on the server and then on the owning client. I personally haven't used these much if any.                                                                    |

<a name="concepts-ga-spec"></a>
#### 4.6.10 Gameplay Ability Spec
A `GameplayAbilitySpec` exists on the `ASC` after a `GameplayAbility` is granted and defines the activatable `GameplayAbility` - `GameplayAbility` class, level, input bindings, and runtime state that must be kept separate from the `GameplayAbility` class.

When a `GameplayAbility` is granted on the server, the server replicates the `GameplayAbilitySpec` to the owning client so that she may activate it.

Activating a `GameplayAbilitySpec` will create an instance (or not for `Non-Instanced` `GameplayAbilities`) of the `GameplayAbility` depending on its `Instancing Policy`.

#### 4.6.11 Passing Data to Abilities
The general paradigm for `GameplayAbilities` is `Activate->Generate Data->Apply->End`. Sometimes you need to act on existing data. GAS provides a few options for getting external data into your `GameplayAbilities`:

| Method                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Activate `GameplayAbility` by Event             | Activate a `GameplayAbility` with an event containing a payload of data. The event's payload is replicated from client to server for local predicted `GameplayAbilities`. Use the two `Optional Object` or the [`TargetData`](#concepts-targeting-data) variables for arbitrary data that does not fit any of the existing variables. The downside to this is that it prevents you from activating the ability with an input bind. To activate a `GameplayAbility` by event, the `GameplayAbility` must have its `Triggers` set up in the `GameplayAbility`. Assign a `GameplayTag` and pick an option for `GameplayEvent`. To send the event, use the function `UAbilitySystemBlueprintLibrary::SendGameplayEventToActor(AActor* Actor, FGameplayTag EventTag, FGameplayEventData Payload)`. |
| Use `WaitGameplayEvent` `AbilityTask`           | Use the `WaitGameplayEvent` `AbilityTask` to tell the `GameplayAbility` to listen for an event with payload data after it activates. The event payload and the process to send it is the same as activating `GameplayAbilities` by event. The downside to this is that events are not replicated by the `AbilityTask` and should only be used for `Local Only` and `Server Only` `GameplayAbilities`. You potentially could write your own `AbilityTask` that will replicate the event payload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Use `TargetData`                                | A custom `TargetData` struct is a good way to pass arbitrary data between the client and server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Store Data on the `OwnerActor` or `AvatarActor` | Use replicated variables stored on the `OwnerActor`, `AvatarActor`, or any other object that you can get a reference to. This method is the most flexible and will work with `GameplayAbilities` activated by input binds. However, it does not guarantee the data will be synchronized from replication at the time of use. You must ensure that ahead of time - meaning if you set a replicated variable and then immediately activate a `GameplayAbility` there is no guarantee the order that will happen on the receiver due to potential packet loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

<a name="concepts-ga-commit"></a>
#### 4.6.12 Ability Cost and Cooldown
`GameplayAbilities` come with functionality for optional costs and cooldowns. Costs are predefined amounts of `Attributes` that the `ASC` must have in order to activate the `GameplayAbility` implemented with an `Instant` `GameplayEffect` ([`Cost GE`](#concepts-ge-cost)). Cooldowns are timers that prevent the reactivation of a `GameplayAbility` until it expires and is implemented with a `Duration` `GameplayEffect` ([`Cooldown GE`](#concepts-ge-cooldown)).

Before a `GameplayAbility` calls `UGameplayAbility::Activate()`, it calls `UGameplayAbility::CanActivateAbility()`. This function checks if the owning `ASC` can afford the cost (`UGameplayAbility::CheckCost()`) and ensures that the `GameplayAbility` is not on cooldown (`UGameplayAbility::CheckCooldown()`).

After a `GameplayAbility` calls `Activate()`, it can optionally commit the cost and cooldown at any time using `UGameplayAbility::CommitAbility()` which calls `UGameplayAbility::CommitCost()` and `UGameplayAbility::CommitCooldown()`. The designer may choose to call `CommitCost()` or `CommitCooldown()` separately if they shouldn't be committed at the same time. Committing cost and cooldown calls `CheckCost()` and `CheckCooldown()` one more time and is the last chance for the `GameplayAbility` to fail related to them. The owning `ASC's` `Attributes` could potentially change after a `GameplayAbility` is activated, failing to meet the cost at time of commit. Committing the cost and cooldown can be [locally predicted](#concepts-p) if the [prediction key](#concepts-p-key) is valid at the time of commit.

See [`CostGE`](#concepts-ge-cost) and [`CooldownGE`](#concepts-ge-cooldown) for implementation details.

<a name="concepts-ga-leveling"></a>
#### 4.6.13 Leveling Up Abilities
There are two common methods for leveling up an ability:

| Level Up Method                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ungrant and Regrant at the New Level       | Ungrant (remove) the `GameplayAbility` from the `ASC` and regrant it back at the next level on the server. This terminates the `GameplayAbility` if it was active at the time.                                   |
| Increase the `GameplayAbilitySpec's` Level | On the server, find the `GameplayAbilitySpec`, increase its level, and mark it dirty so that replicates to the owning client. This method does not terminate the `GameplayAbility` if it was active at the time. |

The main difference between the two methods is if you want active `GameplayAbilities` to be canceled at the time of level up. You will most likely use both methods depending on your `GameplayAbilities`. I recommend adding a `bool` to your `UGameplayAbility` subclass specifying which method to use.

<a name="concepts-ga-sets"></a>
#### 4.6.14 Ability Sets
`GameplayAbilitySets` are convenience `UDataAsset` classes for holding input bindings and lists of startup `GameplayAbilities` for Characters with logic to grant the `GameplayAbilities`. Subclasses can also include extra logic or properties. Paragon had a `GameplayAbilitySet` per hero that included all of their given `GameplayAbilities`.

I find this class to be unnecessary at least given what I've seen of it so far. The Sample Project handles all of the functionality of `GameplayAbilitySets` inside of the `GDCharacterBase` and its subclasses.

<a name="concepts-ga-batching"></a>
#### 4.6.15 Ability Batching
Traditional `Gameplay Ability` lifecycle involves a minimum of two or three RPCs from the client to the server.

1. `CallServerTryActivateAbility()`
1. `ServerSetReplicatedTargetData()` (Optional)
1. `ServerEndAbility()`

If a `GameplayAbility` performs all of these actions in one atomic grouping in a frame, we can optimize this workflow to batch (combine) all two or three RPCs into one RPC. `GAS` refers to this RPC optimization as `Ability Batching`. The common example of when to use `Ability Batching` is for hitscan guns. Hitscan guns activate, do a line trace, send the [`TargetData`](#concepts-targeting-data) to the server, and end the ability all in one atomic group in one frame. The [GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) sample project demonstrates this technique for its hitscan guns.

Semi-Automatic guns are the best case scenario and batch the `CallServerTryActivateAbility()`, `ServerSetReplicatedTargetData()` (the bullet hit result), and `ServerEndAbility()` into one RPC instead of three RPCs.

Full-Automatic/Burst guns batch `CallServerTryActivateAbility()` and `ServerSetReplicatedTargetData()` for the first bullet into one RPC instead of two RPCs. Each subsequent bullet is its own `ServerSetReplicatedTargetData()` RPC. Finally, `ServerEndAbility()` is sent as a separate RPC when the gun stops firing. This is a worst case scenario where we only save one RPC on the first bullet instead of two. This scenario could have also been implemented with activating the ability via a [`Gameplay Event`](#concepts-ga-data) which would send the bullet's `TargetData` in with the `EventPayload` to the server from the client. The downside of the latter approach is that the `TargetData` would have to be generated externally to the ability whereas the batching approach generates the `TargetData` inside of the ability.

`Ability Batching` is disabled by default on the [`ASC`](#concepts-asc). To enable `Ability Batching`, override `ShouldDoServerAbilityRPCBatch()` to return true:

```c++
virtual bool ShouldDoServerAbilityRPCBatch() const override { return true; }
```

Now that `Ability Batching` is enabled, before activating abilities that you want batched, you must create a `FScopedServerAbilityRPCBatcher` struct beforehand. This special struct will try to batch any abilities following it within its scope. Once the `FScopedServerAbilityRPCBatcher` falls out of scope, any abilities activated will not try to batch. `FScopedServerAbilityRPCBatcher` works by having special code in each of the functions that can be batched that intercepts the call from sending the RPC and instead packs the message into a batch struct. When `FScopedServerAbilityRPCBatcher` falls out of scope, it automatically RPCs this batch struct to the server in `UAbilitySystemComponent::EndServerAbilityRPCBatch()`. The server receives the batch RPC in `UAbilitySystemComponent::ServerAbilityRPCBatch_Internal(FServerAbilityRPCBatch& BatchInfo)`. The `BatchInfo` parameter will contain flags for if the ability should end and if input was pressed at the time of activation and the `TargetData` if that was included. This is a good function to put a breakpoint on to confirm that your batching is working properly. Alternatively, use the cvar `AbilitySystem.ServerRPCBatching.Log 1` to enable special ability batching logging.

This mechanism can only be done in C++ and can only activate abilities by their `FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle`.

```c++
bool UGSAbilitySystemComponent::BatchRPCTryActivateAbility(FGameplayAbilitySpecHandle InAbilityHandle, bool EndAbilityImmediately)
{
	bool AbilityActivated = false;
	if (InAbilityHandle.IsValid())
	{
		FScopedServerAbilityRPCBatcher GSAbilityRPCBatcher(this, InAbilityHandle);
		AbilityActivated = TryActivateAbility(InAbilityHandle, true);

		if (EndAbilityImmediately)
		{
			FGameplayAbilitySpec* AbilitySpec = FindAbilitySpecFromHandle(InAbilityHandle);
			if (AbilitySpec)
			{
				UGSGameplayAbility* GSAbility = Cast<UGSGameplayAbility>(AbilitySpec->GetPrimaryInstance());
				GSAbility->ExternalEndAbility();
			}
		}

		return AbilityActivated;
	}

	return AbilityActivated;
}
```

GASShooter reuses the same batched `GameplayAbility` for semi-automatic and full-automatic guns which never directly call `EndAbility()` (it is handled outside of the ability by a local-only ability that manages player input and the call to the batched ability based on the current firemode). Since all of the RPCs must happen within the scope of the `FScopedServerAbilityRPCBatcher`, I provide the `EndAbilityImmediately` parameter so that the controlling/managing local-only can specify whether this ability should batch the `EndAbility()` call (semi-automatic), or not batch the `EndAbility()` call (full-automatic) and the `EndAbility()` call will happen sometime later in its own RPC.

GASShooter exposes a Blueprint node to allow batching abilities which the aforementioned local-only ability uses to trigger the batched ability.

#### 4.6.16 Net Security Policy
A `GameplayAbility`'s `NetSecurityPolicy` determines where should an ability execute on the network. It provides protection from clients attempting to execute restricted abilities.

| `NetSecurityPolicy`     | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ClientOrServer`        | No security requirements. Client or server can trigger execution and termination of this ability freely.                                           |
| `ServerOnlyExecution`   | A client requesting execution of this ability will be ignored by the server. Clients can still request that the server cancel or end this ability. |
| `ServerOnlyTermination` | A client requesting cancellation or ending of this ability will be ignored by the server. Clients can still request execution of the ability.      |
| `ServerOnly`            | Server controls both execution and termination of this ability. A client making any requests will be ignored.                                      |
